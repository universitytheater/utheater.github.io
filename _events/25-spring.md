    - title: "35mm: A Musical Exhibition"
      description: >-
        What does it mean to \"capture life\" in a single frame? Are we defined by the moments \"in focus\" or the ones in between? 35mm: A Musical Exhibition challenges audiences to sink their teeth into a musical that doesn't offer answers, only moments, stopped in time. In a thrilling collaboration between music, dance, and design, 35mm features an eclectic selection of songs created alongside a series of photographs; exploring themes of life, love, and loss and asking us a deceptively simple question: What is it all for? **A free preview will take place Thursday, Apr. 24.**
      time: 'Apr. 24-26, 7:30pm + Apr. 26, 2pm'

    - title: "The Tempest"
      description: >-
        Prospero, a once renowned noble and artist, and his daughter Miranda are stranded on a deserted island, accompanied only by Prospero’s magical powers and magical servants Ariel and Caliban. To enact revenge against his traitorous brother Antonio, Prospero shipwrecks a boat full of nobles onto his island. In the storm the young Prince Ferdinand is separated from the group, in his haze he stumbles upon Miranda, and the two fall in love (much to the chagrin of Prospero). Meanwhile Caliban pressures the nobles’ servants Stephano and Trinculo to kill Prospero and take over the island. As all of this happens Prospero tries in vain to keep control over his domain. Magic abounds, time slips and falls, and ultimately no one is completely sure what is real.
        **A free preview will take place Thursday, May 15.**
      time: 'May 15-17, 7:30pm + May 17, 2pm'
