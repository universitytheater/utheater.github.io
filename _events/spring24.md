    - title: "Strings Attached"
      description: >-
        What does it mean to be human? What does it mean to be a puppet? Will you marry me? All of these questions and more are answered by Strings Attached, a new musical that explores two friends' journeys of self-discovery, commitment, and puppetry. The year is 2012. Jason's tenth anniversary dating his girlfriend Amy is fast approaching, and it's becoming clear that this will present an ultimatum for the future of their relationship. Meanwhile, his best friend Walt hopes to rein in Jason's preposterous proposal plans, but in doing so Walt faces a personal crisis of his own. An encroaching oil baron threatens to ruin everything— and maybe even ruin Christmas. Jason and Walt will consult priests, restaurateurs, and their personal histories in their effort to put together the perfect proposal for Amy. Who's pulling your strings? A free preview will take place Thursday, April 18.
      time: 'Apr. 19-20, 7:30pm & April 20, 2pm'

    - title: "The Play that Goes Wrong"
      description: >-
       The Play that Goes Wrong is a play-within-a-play comedy about a modern day theater group trying to put on The Murder at Haversham Manor, a fictitious murder mystery set in a 1920s English country manor. While often silly, slapstick, and utterly insane, the theater group characters are ultimately grounded in reality - while what goes wrong is incredible, the characters’ reactions are often not - and we hope that the “goes wrong” elements of this show reflect the experiences and senses of humor shared by our company. A free preview will take place Thursday, May 2.
      time: 'May. 3-4, 7:30pm & May 4, 2pm'
      location: '[Logan Theater East](https://goo.gl/maps/Rd7gzsGaCBNaBYrM7)'

    - title: "A Midsummer Night's Dream"
      description: >-
        What do rural Illinois, early 2000s “new age” music, and queer culture have in common with a Shakespearean comedy about forbidden love, donkey heads, and fairies? Surprisingly, a lot. In New Athens, IL—a real place, look it up—Hermia and Lysander are in a queer relationship. Egeus, Hermia’s father, does not approve and tries to force Hermia to marry Demetrius. To escape their plight, the two run away together, only telling Hermia’s friend Helena of their plan. Helena, in love with Demetrius, informs him of their plot and all four make their way into the woods, where chaos ensues. Simultaneously, a new age cover band (the Mechanicals) is trying to make a splash at Theseus’ wedding with their debut original work, The Tragedy of Pyramus and Thisbe, while a secret queer underground watches from the shadows. 
      time: 'May. 9-11, 7:30pm & May. 11, 2pm'
