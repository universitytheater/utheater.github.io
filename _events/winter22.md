    - title: The Light
      description: >-
        Not every marriage proposal goes as planned. Loy A. Webb’s *The Light* introduces us to Rashad and Genesis on what should be one of the happiest days of their lives, but their joy quickly unravels when ground-shifting accusations from the past resurface in this gripping two-character drama. Can their relationship survive the growing divide between them over who – and what – to believe? *The Light* is a reckoning that unfolds in real-time and peels away the layers of truth, doubt, pain, and, ultimately, the power of love. A free preview will take place Thursday, March 3.
      time: 'Mar. 3-5, 7:30pm + Mar. 5, 2pm'
