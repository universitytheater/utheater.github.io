  - title: "[Pericles](/shows/2026/pericles)"
    description:  >-
      Pericles is a show about a journey to find yourself. Our main character, Pericles, starts the play with no understanding of what he wants in life, so takes off on a journey to experience the world. He is tossed and turned at the whims of fate until he finds everything he wants in life, but this happiness is short-lived, as due to a rough storm he loses his wife and daughter, or so he thinks. The second half of the play follows Marina, his daughter, as she tries to find her way back home, and back to a family she never got to know.
    time: 'Feb. 19-21, 7:30pm + Feb. 21, 2pm'
    end_time: 'Feb. 21 2026, 10pm'

  - title: "[Red Rex](/shows/2026/red-rex)"
    description:  >-
      A small theater company moves into an abandoned Chicago storefront. Led by their adventurously thirsty artistic director, they embark on an explosive new play with the hope of finally breaking it big. When the ensemble realizes their source material might not be as original as once assumed, they are thrust into an intense confrontation with residents of their new community, who not only want them out, but will try to take their story back by any means necessary.
    time: 'Feb. 26-28, 7:30pm + Feb. 28, 2pm'
