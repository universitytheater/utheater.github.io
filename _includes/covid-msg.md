Due to COVID-19, our capacity to produce in-person shows may be limited in the 2021-22 academic year. Though guidelines are always evolving, UT and TAPS are committed to giving students access to resources they might require, both creatively and academically. Please direct questions about [in-person guidelines]({{ "about/covid" | relative_url }}) and resources to UT Committee ([ut-committee@uchicago.edu](mailto:ut-commitee@uchicago.edu)) and [TAPS Pro Staff](https://taps.uchicago.edu/people/staff).
