Two pairs of lovers are looking for love: Benedick and Beatric<span class="text_exposed_show">e, whose sparring wits keep you on your toes, and Claudio and Hero, whose genuine feelings are sweetly endearing. Springtime joy and camaraderie are guaranteed, and the ticket is as free as sunshine.</span></span></p><p>
