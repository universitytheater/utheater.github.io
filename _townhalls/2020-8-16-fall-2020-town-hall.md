## Q&A

**I have really cool ideas about next quarter! How can I share them?**
- We want to be responsive to everyone’s needs by being open to suggestions. If people would like us to host another town hall for further discussion, we are open to this!
- We’re planning on hearing more from you all via feedback forms and UT Committee office hours.
  - We have one for questions and thoughts about the town hall at [bit.ly/UTFallFeedback](https://bit.ly/UTFallFeedback)!

**Will we be taking advantage of the 2 weeks of Nice Weather in the beginning?**
- We want to, but it’s also very dependent on what the University mandates for us, which is still very much in the air
- So far, we have no plans for anything in person, especially thinking about people who may not be in Chicago in the fall

**How do I, a first year, get involved?**
- As things are still in the air, the best way is to join our mailing list and Facebook group!
- Reach out to learn about Design Cohorts, since they will still be going virtually!
- TAPS has planned some O-Week welcoming events, including a virtual brunch and Performing Arts Q&A
- Also feel free to reach out to the different Committee members

**Can we be involved even if we’re not in Chicago?**
- Yes!! There will 100% be online opportunities. UT / Committee-Facilitated programming will be very much accessible remotely, but also stay tuned for what community-proposed projects are happening!

**Will Prostaff be available?**
- Yes! Prostaff will be available to help you work/talk through anything. Reach out because they absolutely want to Share some Wisdom about working in a virtual space. They will also be in their own spaces in the fall, unlike this past quarter

**What is happening with Tech/Student Staff?**
- It’s still unclear and up in the air. Stay tuned as we learn more

**What’s happening with the budget?**
- Also unclear. Our funds were frozen last quarter, but we haven’t really heard anything new yet. We’ll hopefully get that information soon

**What’s happening in the rest of the UT Cinematic Universe?**
- Off-Off Campus is also fully online and will be having auditions over Zoom
- Dean’s Men: like us on Facebook! They will be doing things online too
- Court Theater: will be having a virtual and in-person theater season for 2020-2021, with in-person shows scheduled to start in February
- Stay tuned for more collaboration between Court and the University, as Court is trying to get students more involved with their productions

**Who can I contact if I have more questions?**
- Are you a first year with Questions? Do you have more questions about this upcoming Fall Quarter? Contact: Caitlyn ([cklum@uchicago.edu](mailto:cklum@uchicago.edu))
- Are you a first year interested in Design? Contact: Isaiah ([isaiahzs@uchicago.edu](mailto:isaiahzs@uchicago.edu))
- The rest of Committee’s emails can be found [here](https://arts.uchicago.edu/theater-and-performance-studies/performance-rsos/university-theater/ut-student-committee). We’re very nice!
