## IV. Theater[24]

### A. Purpose

Since at least 2009, Theater[24] is a quarterly theater festival of new work that is written, directed, rehearsed, and designed by University of Chicago students within 24 hours. It traditionally occurs on the first week of each quarter, although it can occasionally be postponed to second week due to religious holidays or other conflicting events. Theater[24] is a zany and hectic experience for anyone who wants to get involved with theater at the University of Chicago, but doesn’t want to commit more than 24 hours to it!

### B. Production Process / What Theater[24] Curators Do

1.  9<sup>th</sup>-10<sup>th</sup> week of the quarter before: Curators meet to decide the theme of this quarter’s Theater[24]. The theme serves as a prompt for the writers and as a way to connect all the plays together into a cohesive one-night festival. Curators then create a sign-up form for the festival. The sign-up form should ask for:

      * Name
      * Pronouns
      * Year
      * Email and phone number
      * Roommate’s email and phone number
      * A ranking of the positions they would most like in the festival: Writer, Actor, Designer, Director
      * What other quarters they have participated in the festival
      * IF THEY CHOSE WRITER: Who would they like to write with? Would they be willing to write with a stranger?
      * Why they want to be involved in this quarter's festival and why they chose the positions you did.
      * A creative writing prompt (usually related to the theme in some way).

Curators should also start reaching out to UT Alumni to act as dramaturg. A dramaturg (not a currently enrolled UChicago undergraduate student) stays awake with the writers throughout the night, offering writing tips, dramaturgical advice, and emotional support, while the curators are asleep.

      * Dramaturgs are reached out to, and selected by, the Theater[24] Curator team at least a week in advance of the quarter’s festival. 


2. Over O-Week/Winter Break/Spring Break: Curators send out the sign-up form for the festival to the University Theater and Theater[24] listhosts. The form should be completed by a Wednesday 1st week 10:00 pm deadline.

3.  Wednesday 1<sup>st</sup> week 10pm or later: Curators meet to read the form responses. This is an anonymous process when selecting writing submissions, requiring one of the curators to replace names of writers with numbers for the sake of unbiased arbitration. The curators begin by reading the creative writing submissions of those who have picked Writer as their most preferred position (because writers tend to be the most competitive position). The curators decide who they believe should be writers and pair them accordingly, being careful to take note of writers who have requested to be paired with other writers as well as those who have said they would not feel comfortable writing with a stranger. The rest of the positions can be filled as the curators see fit, ensuring there is at least one previous festival participant in each group.
      * Anyone who signs up for the festival can join (there is no audition process), unless more people sign up than are able to participate due to sheer logistics. This participation cap is under curator discretion. If curators must turn people away or place them on a waitlist, they must prioritize including those who have never participated in the festival before, and exclude those who have been involved with Theater[24] many times.
      * There should be at least FOUR (4) plays in a festival and no more than SIX (6).
      * Every writer should have a partner. Under extenuating circumstances, writers may write in a trio.
      * Each play should have at least THREE (3) actors, unless there is no way to have a festival without a two-actor play.
          * Never should Theater[24] produce a one-person show.
      * If there is a shortage of participants, curators may step in for actors, directors, or designers. This should only be done under dire circumstances.

    As soon as arbitration is over, curators must send out emails alerting participants to their positions. These emails should include a link to an RSVP form, confirming their positions in the festival by that noon on Friday. The emails should also tell participants when and where they need to be that weekend. 

4. Friday 1<sup>st</sup> week 6pm: Curators, writers, directors, designers, and actors meet in the FXK Theater to introduce themselves. The curators introduce the festival and the theme for the quarter. The actors then each give 60 second introductions on the stage, while writers and directors take notes. By 7pm, actors are dismissed.

5. After the actors are dismissed, the curators give the writers, designers, and directors explain the capabilities and limitations of the performing space. Then, the curators match the writers with their designers and directors. They give out the writing prompts and cast lists to the writers. The writers, designers, and directors are free to discuss their initial ideas with each other, until 8:00pm. Then, the designers and directors are dismissed.

6. Writers then go to that night’s writing location (which can be on Zoom, if preferred by writers), where they meet the dramaturg and curator(s). The writers and dramaturg work alongside at least one curator until the next morning to write new plays!
     {:.ul-lower-roman}
     * During the night, the dramaturg and curator should establish the festival’s show order.
     * The dramaturg should also act as a cursory sensitivity reader i.e. making sure no one writes an offensive play that might make directors/actors/designers feel unsafe/dehumanized.

7. At 7:45am, the final scripts are due to the curators by email. A curator prints scripts in Reynolds 001 using the UT copy code and brings them to the performance space.

8. At 9:00am, writers are brought to the performing space to meet with directors and designers. They speak about their plays and artistic visions.

9. At 9:30am, actors arrive. Curators take attendance and tell the festival participants which teams they are working in. Once the entire team for a play has arrived, they can start their readthroughs.

10. Once the readthroughs are over, writers are sent home to sleep.

11. Curators then schedule each play’s allotted rehearsal time in the performing space. Each play should have the opportunity to rehearse in the theater before tech.

12. Actors and directors are dismissed to go and rehearse wherever they please. 

13. In the afternoon, Tech will be run by the curators and will feature a Q2Q of each of the shows

14. After a break for dinner, writers, directors, and designers are called back into the theater for 7:00pm warmups.

15. At 7:30pm, the house opens.

16. 8:00pm: the festival is performed! Curators introduce the festival and perform the fire speech, and let the audience know of upcoming UT shows that quarter.

17. After the audience has left, everyone involved in Theater[24] must help with Theater Cleaning!

18. The following day a feedback form is sent out to the participants and no more than two weeks later, the curators conduct a Post Mortem.

### C. Theater 24 and University Theater

* Upon the election of each new University Theater Committee, one of its members should be selected to be that Committee’s liaison for Theater[24]. This role includes:

  *  Being present for arbitration, meet-and-greet, the show, and cleanup. They should also be available throughout the day Saturday for tech and other needs upon curator request.
  *  Conflict resolution between participants of the festival.

### D. Curator Responsibilities

* There should be at least THREE (3) curators at each festival. If TWO (2) or fewer curators are able to participate in a particular quarter’s festival, a member or more of University Theater Committee should volunteer to support the remaining curators at that festival.
* Curators should ensure that the festival runs smoothly according to the timeline exhibited in Section B.
* If there are conflicts between participants of the festival, the curators should be the primary mode of contact.
* If there are conflicts between the curators of the festival, the curators should reach out to their University Theater Committee Liaison for conflict resolution.

### E. Curator Hiring Process

* Each spring quarter, University Theater Committee ought to reach out to the University Theater listhost to ask for applications to become a Theater[24] curator.

    * This application process should involve an interview with a curator of at least three previous Theater[24] shows for new curator applicants. 

* It is important that curators have some sort of training before they are launched into their first show in the whacky, stressful, exhilarating world of Theater[24].

    * Applicants should have at least one quarter of experience with Theater[24].
    * Cumulatively, the team of curators should ideally have prior experience with stage/production management, sound design, and light design. This experience could be with University Theater or elsewhere.

### F. Amendments

* Theater[24] curators of any of the previous three quarters of the festival may suggest amendments to these Bylaws, to be voted on by University Theater Committee and by other Theater[24] curators of any of the previous three quarters of the festival.
* University Theater Committee may also suggest amendments to these Bylaws, to be voted on by University Theater Committee and by other Theater[24] curators of any of the previous three quarters of the festival.
