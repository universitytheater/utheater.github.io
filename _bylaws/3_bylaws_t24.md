## IV. Theater[24]

### A. Purpose

Since at least 2009, Theater[24] is a quarterly theater festival of new work that is written, directed, rehearsed, and designed by University of Chicago students within 24 hours. It traditionally occurs on the first week of each quarter, although it can occasionally be postponed to second week due to religious holidays or other conflicting events. Theater[24] is a zany and hectic experience for anyone who wants to get involved with theater at the University of Chicago, but doesn’t want to commit more than 24 hours to it!

### B. Production Process / What Theater[24] Curators Do

1.  9<sup>th</sup>-10<sup>th</sup> week of the quarter before: Curators meet to decide the theme of this quarter’s Theater[24]. The theme serves as a prompt for the writers and as a way to connect all the plays together into a cohesive one-night festival. Curators then create a sign-up form for the festival. The sign-up form should ask for:

      * Name
      * Pronouns
      * Year
      * Email and phone number
      * Roommate’s email and phone number
      * A ranking of the positions they would most like in the festival: Writer, Actor, Designer, Director
      * What other quarters they have participated in the festival
      * IF THEY CHOSE WRITER: Who would they like to write with? Would they be willing to write with a stranger?
      * Why they want to be involved in this quarter's festival and why they chose the positions you did.
      * A creative writing prompt (usually related to the theme in some way).

    Curators should also start reaching out to Chicago theater professionals for a dramaturg. A dramaturg is a Chicago theater professional (not a currently enrolled UChicago undergraduate student) who stays with the writers throughout the night, offering writing tips, dramaturgical advice, and emotional support, while the curators are asleep.

      * They are paid $300 by TAPS for working between the hours of 8:30pm and 8am Friday night of the festival.
      * Dramaturgs are reached out to, and selected by, the Theater[24] Curator team at least a week in advance of the quarter’s festival. Upon dramaturg selection, curators will reach out to Neel with the dramaturg’s email such that payment and official forms can be completed.

2. Over O-Week/Winter Break/Spring Break: Curators send out the sign-up form for the festival to the University Theater and Theater[24] listhosts. The form should be completed by a Wednesday 1 st week 9pm deadline.
3.  Wednesday 1<sup>st</sup> week 9pm or later: Curators meet to read the form responses. This is an anonymous process, requiring one of the curators to replace names with numbers for the sake of unbiased arbitration. The curators begin by reading the creative writing submissions of those who have picked Writer as their most preferred position (because writers tend to be the most competitive position). The curators decide who they believe should be writers and pair them accordingly. The rest of the positions can be filled as the curators see fit.
      * Anyone who signs up for the festival can join (there is no audition process), unless more people sign up than are able to participate due to sheer logistics. This participation cap is under curator discretion. If curators must turn people away or place them on a waitlist, they must prioritize including those who have never participated in the festival before, and exclude those who have been involved with Theater[24] many times.
      * There should be at least FOUR (4) plays in a festival and no more than SIX (6).
      * Every writer should have a partner. Under extenuating circumstances, writers may write in a trio.
      * Each play should have at least THREE (3) actors, unless there is no way to have a festival without a two-actor play.
      * Never should Theater[24] produce a one-person show.
      * If there is a shortage of participants, the position ‘Designer’ can be replaced by the curators. The curators may also step in for actors or directors. This should only be done under dire circumstances.

    As soon as arbitration is over, curators must send out emails alerting participants to their positions. These emails should include a link to an RSVP form, confirming their positions in the festival by that Thursday’s midnight. The emails should also tell participants when and where they need to be that weekend. (See Appendices 2.A, 2.B, 2.C, and 2.D.)

4. Friday 1<sup>st</sup> week 6pm: Curators, writers, directors, designers, and actors meet in the FXK Theater to introduce themselves. The curators introduce the festival and the theme for the quarter. The actors then each give 60 second introductions on the stage, while writers and directors take notes. By 7pm, actors are dismissed.
5. After the actors are dismissed, the curators give the writers, designers, and directors a tour of the theater. This involves telling them the capabilities (and limitations) of the FXK tech equipment. The designers are dismissed.
6. Then, the curators match the writers with their directors. They give out the writing prompts to the writers and randomized cast lists. The writers and directors are free to discuss their initial ideas with each other, until 8pm. The directors are dismissed.
7. The curators and the writers go to BartMart to stock up on snacks for the night. They then go to that night’s writing location, where they meet the dramaturg. The curators go home, while the writers and dramaturg work until the next morning to write new plays!
    * During the night, the dramaturg should establish the festival’s show order.
    * Usually, the dramaturg will ask that the writers complete a first draft of their plays by midnight. However, it is the dramaturg’s choice as to how they want to structure the night.
    * The dramaturg should also act as a cursory sensitivity reader i.e. making sure no one writes an offensive play that might make directors/actors/designers feel unsafe/dehumanized.
8. At 7:45am, the final scripts are due to the Theater[24] email account. A curator prints scripts in Reynolds 001 using the UT copy code and brings them to the FXK.
9. At 8:15am, writers are brought to the FXK to meet with directors. They speak about their plays and artistic visions.
10. At 8:30am, actors and designers arrive. Curators take attendance and tell the festival participants which teams they are working in. Once the entire team for a play has arrived, they can start their readthroughs.
11. Once the readthroughs are over, writers are sent home to sleep.
12. Curators then schedule each play’s allotted rehearsal time in the FXK. Each play should have the opportunity to rehearse in the theater before tech.
13. Actors and directors are dismissed to go and rehearse wherever they please. Depending on how many designers there are, the curators will help design and program the shows’ light and sound cues.
14. At 4pm, tech begins. Tech will be run by the curators and will feature a Q2Q of each of the shows. At least ONE (1) member of Tech Staff should be clocked on and present to help with production.
15. After a break for dinner, writers, directors, and designers are called back into the theater for 7pm warmups.
16. At 7:30pm, house opens.
17. 8pm: the festival is performed! Curators introduce the festival and perform the fire speech.
18. When the shows have been performed, curators let the audience know of future University Theater shows that quarter.
19. After the audience has left, everyone involved in Theater[24] must help with Theater Cleaning!

### C. Theater 24 and University Theater

* Upon the election of each new University Theater Committee, one of its members should be selected to be that Committee’s liaison for Theater[24]. This role includes:

  *  Being present for arbitration, meet-and-greet, the show, and cleanup. They should also be available throughout the day Saturday for tech and other needs upon curator request.
  *  Conflict resolution between participants of the festival.
  *  Organizing, running, and processing post-mortems of each festival.
  *  Spearheading the application process for Theater[24] curators. (See E: Curator Hiring Process)

### D. Curator Responsibilities

* There should be at least FOUR (4) curators at each festival. If THREE (3) or fewer curators are able to participate in a particular quarter’s festival, a member or more of University Theater Committee should volunteer to support the remaining curators at that festival.
* Curators should ensure that the festival runs smoothly according to the timeline exhibited in Section B.
* If there are conflicts between participants of the festival, the curators should be the primary mode of contact, unless they choose to reach out to their Committee Liaison as per the CTS conflict resolution pathway.
* If there are conflicts between the curators of the festival, the curators should reach out to their University Theater Committee Liaison for conflict resolution.

### E. Curator Hiring Process

* Each winter quarter, before the Committee turnaround, University Theater Committee ought to reach out to the University Theater listhost to ask for applications to become a Theater[24] curator. All potential curators will fill out the application, experienced and new will fill out this application for the next year of Theater[24].

    * This application process should involve an interview with a member of University Theater Committee, ideally the Theater[24] liaison, and a curator of at least three previous Theater[24] shows for new curator applicants. Experienced curators will also re-interview for the position with the liason, but not with another curator.
    * Although the application process will be for the next three quarters (Spring, Fall, Winter), the applicant will be allowed to selectively apply for any/all of those next three quarters. This is so that applicants who wish to graduate/study abroad are still invited to curate as many festivals as they would like.
    * It is Committee’s responsibility to make sure that they accept at least FOUR (4) applicants for each of the next three quarters.
* It is important that curators have some sort of training before they are launched into their first show in the whacky, stressful, exhilarating world of Theater[24].

    * This training should include at least ONE (1) festival credit shadowing the experienced curators of Theater[24]. This training can occur after/during the application process.
    * Cumulatively, team of curators should ideally have prior experience with stage/production management, sound design, and light design. This experience could be with University Theater or elsewhere.
    * That spring quarter, previous curators shall be invited back to help the new curators learn the ropes of curating the festival. Depending on how many new applicants there are (and the skillsets of those new applicants), UT Committee may invite more or fewer previous curators to help with the training process.

### F. Amendments

* Theater[24] curators of any of the previous three quarters of the festival may suggest amendments to these Bylaws, to be voted on by University Theater Committee and by other Theater[24] curators of any of the previous three quarters of the festival.
* University Theater Committee may also suggest amendments to these Bylaws, to be voted on by University Theater Committee and by other Theater[24] curators of any of the previous three quarters of the festival.
