## V. The University Theater Proposal Process

### A. Types of Work

1. One-Quarter Shows: Performances take place during the 7th or 8th week of Fall, Winter, and Spring Quarter and are passed one quarter prior to their performance quarter. One-Quarter shows may also take place during 6th week if no Cross-Quarter shows are scheduled, but shows in the same space (e.g. FXK, Theater West) cannot take place in consecutive weeks.
2. Cross-Quarter Shows: Performances take place during the 6th week of Winter and Spring Quarter and are passed two quarters prior to the quarter of their performance. These shows can take place in Theater West, Theater East, 501, or a site-specific alternative depending upon availability. The Cross-Quarter model is intended for productions that want more flexible rehearsal scheduling, increased rehearsal time to accommodate performance duration, and/or additional time to develop design elements.
3. Collaborations: RSOs may propose to collaborate with UT to produce One-Quarter and Cross-Quarter shows, utilizing UT resources and following a similar proposal process and timeline.
4. Workshops: Performances take place during 4th or 5th Week of Fall and Winter Quarters and are passed one quarter prior to their performance quarter. Workshops are intended for works, particularly new or student-written work, with a shorter running time. Workshops have smaller-scale stage design, with an appropriate scope decided between Committee and proposers after proposals are passed.
5. Site-Specific Work: Performance pieces and installations that are located in Logan 501 or other locations on campus, pending University administration approval and the availability of desired resources (e.g. scale of designs, space availability). The 8th Week of Spring Quarter is reserved for site-specific work. However, if no site-specific work is scheduled for that time slot by 4th Week of Winter Quarter, Committee may accept proposals for Workshops and/or One-Quarter Shows during the 8th Week of Spring Quarter at its discretion. Site-specific works have flexible scheduling, and they may also be scheduled during the weeks mentioned in V.A.1 and V.A.2 if no mainstage shows are scheduled during those time slots after the Spring Proposal Meeting.
6. Staged Readings:  A festival of staged readings of student-written plays may take place during the 6th Week of Fall and Spring Quarters in Logan 501. Staged readings are intended to be an easy and low-commitment avenue to get involved with UT and for student playwrights to hear their work on stage.


### B. Proposing Mainstages

1. #### One-Quarter and Cross-Quarter Productions
    * A proposer must request a proposal liaison from Committee. The proposal liaison will meet with the proposer to discuss any questions the proposer might have about the proposal process.
    * Proposers must meet with the Director of Performance and the Committee Chair. These individuals may recommend meeting with other members of TAPS Pro-staff. Proposers must meet with the Managing Director to discuss rights, if applicable. Proposers are also strongly encouraged to meet with the Managing Director and Committee Treasurer to discuss rough budgets.
    *  Mainstage shows are divided into One-Quarter and Cross-Quarter shows and are distinguished by their different budget amounts (see I.C.4). Each show type occurs at a specific time each quarter, as specified in Section V.A.
    *  Proposers must turn in their proposal to Committee, emailed to [ut-committee@uchicago.edu](mailto:ut-committee@uchicago.edu). Proposals are due in two rounds:

        * Round I: One-Quarter and Cross-Quarter proposals for the following academic year are due by 5:00pm on Friday of 4th Week in Spring Quarter.

        * Round II: Additional One-Quarter and Cross-Quarter proposals for 8th Week of Winter Quarter, 3rd Week of Spring Quarter, and 7th Week of Spring Quarter will be considered if no shows are scheduled for those times after the Round I Mainstage Proposal Executive Session. These proposals are due by 5:00pm on Friday of 4th Week in Fall Quarter.

    * In the week after proposals are due, proposers arrange time to meet with individual Committee members to discuss their proposal. Committee members are required to read all proposals and make themselves available for individual meetings.
    *   The proposal should include the following components:

          * Name and information about the proposer.
          * Cast size and Gender breakdown.
          * Running time.
          * Space preference.
          * The proposed scale (One-Quarter, Cross-Quarter) and week(s) the proposer would prefer.
          * A requested budget amount and rough breakdown that corresponds with the proposed scale. See Section I.C.4 for more information.
          * Whether or not the show has been passed or performed on campus in the last three years.  
          * Three important images pivotal to the play.
          * The driving question and themes behind the production.
          * The production design aesthetic of the play and the textual justification for the aesthetic choice.
          * Bios for all staff members. These bios should include qualifications for the position as well as a statement about their particular area on the production.
          * While it is not required, inclusion rough drawings of set and costumes is suggested to strengthen the proposal.
          * The production’s plan for the level of inclusion of understudies and/or a rough delineation of the production’s plan in the event of an actor being unable to perform their role. To read about understudies please see [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GLBnYfXQ5W3tnD_n72Ez6XLypn6T8nvcoKNubNXu8IQ/edit?usp=sharing). 

    * The community-wide Mainstage Proposal Meeting is held in the 5<sup>th</sup> Week of Spring and Fall Quarter. No UT activity may be scheduled during the community-wide Proposal Meeting.
    * Before the Proposal Meeting, the Committee Chair will meet with the relevant TAPS Pro-staff member(s) in order to discuss space scheduling. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss any schedule iterations that might be challenging so that the season can be scheduled in an informed manner after passing. If a performance space desired by proposers is unavailable during the weeks indicated in Section V.A, Committee may schedule a passed show to perform one week before or after the indicated weeks.
    * After all proposers have spoken, Committee proceeds into the Executive (Closed) Session (see Section IV.A.3). Proposers, or non-proposer directors, who are also members of Committee are not allowed to sit in on the Executive Session Proposal Meeting or to vote on the season. If the Director for the Dean’s Men show is on Committee, however, they are permitted to take part in scheduling and vote on the season just as any other Committee member.

2.  #### Collaborations
    RSOs may propose to collaborate with UT with the same deadline as mainstage proposals.
      * Proposers contact RSOs expressing an interest in collaborating. If another RSO would like to propose through UT, they must choose a primary proposer and follow the standard UT proposal process. 
      * Collaboration proposers are encouraged to meet with the TAPS Director of Performance and TAPS Pro-staff to discuss their proposals. Proposers meet with the Managing Director to discuss rights, if applicable.
      * Proposers must complete the Season Proposal Form and turn in their proposal as described in Section V.B.1.d, emailed to [ut-committee@uchicago.edu](mailto:ut-committee@uchicago.edu)).
      * The proposal should include the following components:

          * Name and information about the collaborating RSO, the proposer, and their relationship to the organization.
          * A brief description of the Collaboration project and explanation of why a collaboration would be beneficial.

      * As detailed in Sections V.B.1.g-i, the community-wide Season Mainstage Proposal Meeting is held on Friday of 5th Week of Spring Quarter. Proposers follow the same procedure regarding presenting their proposal and cannot participate in the Executive Session Proposal Meeting if they are part of Committee. 

3. #### Site Specific Works
 If proposers would like to propose work for an alternative space they may propose with the same deadlines as mainstage proposals.
    * Individuals may propose site-specific work to be produced by UT. Projects appropriate for site-specific production include pieces in spaces other than Theater West, Theater East, or the FXK. The proposers are encouraged to meet with the TAPS Managing Director to discuss the production rights as well as the TAPS Production Manager to discuss the feasibility of locations cited.
    * Site Specific proposers are encouraged to meet with the TAPS Director of Performance and TAPS Pro-staff to discuss their proposals. Proposers meet with the Managing Director to discuss rights, if applicable.
    * Proposers must complete the Season Proposal Form and turn in their proposal as described in Section V.B.1.d, emailed to ut-committee@uchicago.edu. 
    * The proposal should answer the following Site-Specific Works sections of the Season Proposal Form: 
        * A brief description of the site-specific project.
        * Spaces under consideration.
        * Feasibility and plan for acquiring the space including budget, scheduling needs, and other applicable information.
    * As detailed in Sections V.B.1.g-i, the community-wide Season Mainstage Proposal Meeting is held on Friday of 5th Week of Spring and Fall Quarter. Proposers follow the same procedure regarding presenting their proposal and cannot participate in the Executive Session Proposal Meeting if they are part of Committee. 

4. #### Mainstage Proposal Executive Session
    * Directly after the community-wide meeting, Committee goes into Executive Session to discuss each proposal individually. Committee members who are proposing or directing a show in discussion may not be present at this meeting. Committee members who are proposing or directing a show in discussion may not be present at this meeting. In this meeting, Committee considers whether a show:

        * Is appropriate to the proposer in terms of its scope and the proposer's relevant experience.
        * Identifies the proposer's focused goals for the production and communicates that the proposer has a clear and specific vision of the play.
        * Fits with University Theater's four pillars of Opportunity, Education, Artistic Excellence, and Community.
        * Contains an appropriate staff, including Director, Stage Manager, and Designers (filling the staff as best as possible by the proposal meeting is encouraged but not required).
        * Is of feasible technical difficulty and requirements, given current UT equipment and personnel.
    *   ##### Procedure and Policy for the Committee Proposal Meeting

          * The Proposal Meeting is run by the Committee Chair. If the Chair is proposing, the meeting will be run by an officer in the order of presidential succession. If all officers are proposing, another member of Committee will be selected at the prior Committee meeting by simple majority vote.
          * Quorum must be reached, with at least four of those members being elected, non-staff student members. If quorum cannot be reached with the current Committee members, outgoing Committee members, who are graduating or decided to not run for Committee again, can be voted into the meeting by simple majority at the prior Committee meeting in the order as follows up until quorum is reached. 
            * Chair
            * Treasurer
            * Secretary 
            * Social Chair 
            * Outreach Chair 
            * General Members who are graduating 
            * General Members who are not graduating 
          * Committee does not vote for or against a proposal on a comparative basis. They base their vote solely on the proposal, and only weigh it in relation to other proposals when they vote on scheduling.
          * Committee takes a straw vote for each proposal, with the options of “yes,” “no,” or “discuss.” If any proposal receives enough “yes” votes such that the number of “discuss” votes does not challenge its majority, that proposal is automatically passed. If the proposal receives enough “no” votes such that the number of “discuss” votes does not challenge its majority, that proposal is automatically not passed. If there is no majority or the number of “discuss” votes threatens the existing majority, the proposal is then evaluated in the form of a list of pros and cons. Each Committee member presents at least one pro or one con in order to create these lists.
          * After ALL lists are made for each show being considered, the shows are discussed in greater detail and pro/cons are clarified if necessary.
          * Once discussion is completed, Committee votes on each proposal. In this vote, proposals pass if they receive a simple majority of votes. A proposal must have at least half the votes in the room to pass.
    *   ##### Scheduling
        Once shows are passed, they are then scheduled. At times, shows can be passed but not scheduled due to limited resources. During scheduling, other productions (such as the Weekend(s) of Workshops or Staged Readings) are also scheduled. Once the season has been scheduled, Committee votes on the entire season as scheduled, requiring a simple majority to pass. Committee then reflects upon the season as a whole. Mainstages and Collaborations that are scheduled for the UT season are assigned Committee Liaisons. The Weekend(s) of Workshops, or other such productions are also assigned liaisons at this time. If there are multiple Weekends of Workshops, each one receives its own liaison. After the season is scheduled by Committee, it is passed onto TAPS Pro-staff and the Center for Leadership & Involvement to confirm spaces.
    *   ##### Calling Proposers
        After the season has been scheduled and reflected upon, Committee Liaisons will contact their respective proposers regarding the status of their proposal and its tentative scheduling. The Committee member running the meeting contacts the proposers whose shows were not scheduled. All Committee members must call their proposers by phone. If not reachable, then they must send an email, or meet in person. The Committee member running the meeting should make their best effort to contact all proposers as soon as possible. Once all proposers have been reached and the season’s space schedule is confirmed by TAPS and the CLI, the season may be announced by the Committee Chair via the UT general listhost.
    *   ##### Post-Meeting Process: Mainstage
        Once scheduled, the staff of each Mainstage is encouraged to meet with TAPS Pro-staff to continue to develop design plans, as well as to attend their respective cohorts. They will also be reminded that to be cast, all actors must audition. 

5. #### Committee-Produced Mainstages.
    * Following the Round I and Round II Mainstage Proposal Executive Sessions, if no show is scheduled during a time slot that may only be proposed for during that round (i.e. Fall/early Winter mainstage slots for Round I and remaining mainstage slots for Round II), Committee may vote to produce additional mainstage shows to fill those slots. This vote must occur at most one week after the Mainstage Proposal Meeting. Committee first votes on the number of additional mainstages they will produce by simple majority, then they vote on scripts using ranked choice voting. Any member of Committee may propose a script to be voted on. After scripts are decided, they are scheduled for a performance time and space, decided through simple majority vote.
    * After scripts are decided, Committee is responsible for soliciting applications to direct the show(s). Prospective directors make time in the week following when applications are due to meet with Committee members individually, and Committee discusses and votes on a suitable director for each show using ranked choice voting. If a director in consideration is on Committee, they may not participate in voting.
    * Committee is responsible for assembling a full production team for each mainstage (i.e. Director, Stage Manager, Production Manager, and Designers) at least six weeks prior to the show’s auditions. If the production team is incomplete after that point, the show may not be produced.
    * Once a show has a full production team, the production process proceeds as described in Section VI.

### C. Workshops

1. #### Proposal Process
    * Proposers are encouraged to meet with the Director of TAPS to discuss their proposals. Proposers meet with the Managing Director to discuss rights, if applicable.
    * Proposers turn in their proposal by Friday of 5<sup>th</sup> Week by 5pm to the Committee Chair's mailbox and electronically, emailed to [ut-committee@uchicago.edu](mailto:ut-committee@uchicago.edu)).
    *   The proposal should include the following components:

          * Name and information about the proposer.
          * Cast size and Gender breakdown.
          * Running time.
          * Space/week preference, if there is an option (i.e., multiple Weekends of Workshops in different spaces).
          * Three important images pivotal to the play.
          * The driving question and themes behind the production.
          * The production design aesthetic of the play and the textual justification for the aesthetic choice.

        See Appendix 1.B for the Workshops Proposal Form

    * The Workshops Proposal Meeting is held at the start of the 6<sup>th</sup> Week Committee Meeting, at 5pm. Each proposer has one minute to present their proposal and two minutes to answer the questions of Committee and community members.
    * After all proposers have spoken, they are excused and the Committee proceeds into the Executive (Closed) Session. Proposers who are also members of Committee are not allowed to sit in Executive Session Proposal Meeting or to vote on the Workshops. Once the Workshops have been voted on, proposers on Committee are permitted back into the room for the rest of the 6<sup>th</sup> Week Committee meeting, which proceeds as usual.
    * Committee may accept workshops on a rolling basis at their discretion, up to the Friday of 8th Week. Workshop proposers then present their proposal at the following Committee meeting, following the procedures outlined in this section.
2. #### Workshops Proposal Executive Session
    * Directly after the Workshops proposers have spoken, Committee goes into Executive Session to discuss each proposal individually. In this meeting, Committee considers whether a workshop:

        * Is appropriate to the proposer in terms of its scope and the proposer's relevant experience.
        * Identifies the proposer's focused goals for the production and communicates that the proposer has a clear and specific vision of the play.
        * Fits with University Theater's Mission Statement of Opportunity, Education, Artistic Excellence, and Community.
        * Is of feasible technical difficulty and requirements, given the Workshops format and restrictions, as well as current University Theater equipment and personnel.
    * ##### Procedure and Policy for the Workshops Proposal Meeting

        * The Proposal Meeting is run by the Director of Performance Programs and the Committee Chair. If the Chair is proposing, the Treasurer runs the meeting. If the Treasurer is also proposing, the Secretary runs the meeting. If all three officers are proposing, another member of Committee will be selected at the prior Committee meeting by simple majority vote.
        * While the driving question in the Mainstage Proposal meeting is, "Why pass this show?" the driving question in the Workshops Proposal meeting is, "Why not?" in the interest of opportunity. To that end, each proposal is discussed briefly, addressing any concerns with the proposal.
        * Progressing through each individual proposal in this way, Committee constructs a full lineup of Workshops.
        * Committee then votes on this line up. If discussion is still required and/or if Committee is still divided upon the season, they may move to pass Workshops individually until the lineup is complete and all Proposals have been addressed.
    * ##### Scheduling
        In the event that there are multiple Weekends of Workshops, Workshops that pass must be scheduled into one of the weekends. Once the Weekend(s) have been scheduled, Committee votes on the entire Workshops lineup as scheduled, requiring a simple majority to pass. Committee then reflects upon the Workshops lineup as a whole.
    * ##### Calling Proposers
        After the Workshops have been scheduled and reflected upon, the Committee Liaison(s) for Workshops will contact their various proposers regarding the status of their proposal and its scheduling. The Committee member running the meeting contacts the proposers whose shows were not scheduled. All Committee members must speak to their proposers by phone, _not_ via email or in person. The proposer must also be reached _directly_ by phone; voice mails are not permitted. Once all proposers have been reached directly by phone, the season may be announced by the Committee Chair via the UT general listhost.
    * ##### Post-Meeting Process
        Once scheduled, the Director and SM of each Workshop are encouraged to meet with UT/TAPS Pro-staff to continue to develop design plans, as well as to attend their respective cohorts.

### D. Staged Readings

1. Staged readings are facilitated by an organizing team composed of Committee members.
2. For each festival, play submissions are due by the end of 1st Week of the quarter of the festival, and sign-ups to direct, act in, or stage manage plays are due by 3rd Week of the quarter.
3. After sign-ups are closed, the organizing team will match participants with scripts by the Friday of 4th Week. To the extent possible, organizers will ensure each script gets read and each person who has signed up has a role.
4. Each play’s team may rehearse up to two times, with each rehearsal being no longer than two hours. Rehearsal space bookings may be coordinated with the organizing team.
5. During the festival, actors will read from scripts and will not have blocking. There may only be minimal design elements (e.g. handheld props).
