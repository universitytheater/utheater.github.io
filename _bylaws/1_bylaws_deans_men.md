## II. The Dean's Men

### A. Purpose

Founded in 2006, The Dean's Men is a student organization at the University of Chicago dedicated to the works of William Shakespeare. Through University Theater productions and other activities, we strive to bring the Bard's writing to the school and create a community of theater makers in the process. We are dedicated to this community, which prospers through social events as well as the rehearsal process. We believe in the importance of its warm, joyous existence. As we continue to cultivate and strengthen our art, so we continue to cultivate and strengthen our community. Once a Dean's Man, always a Dean's Man.

In addition to our quarterly University Theater show, we take part in community outreach, engage with academic resources, and participate in other artist and social endeavors. In the past, such endeavors have included directing a yearly Shakespeare show with local middle school students at St. Thomas Academy, organizing bi-weekly play readings, and hosting gatherings with David Bevington, the world-renowned Shakespeare scholar.

Once a Dean's Man, always a Dean's Man

### B. Production Process

The Dean’s Men will perform three shows per year. Once a director and show have been selected for a particular quarter, the Board will assist the director in filling a staff and finding a space, as need be. The selected Dean’s Men show is then submitted to University Theater so that a space and week may be selected with sensitivity to the UT season (see below). The Dean’s Men productions, as UT productions, will fully participate in UT production requirements such as arbitration and space scheduling.

If a show passes the Dean’s Men voting process during Fall or Winter Quarter, this production automatically goes into the Fall or Winter Quarter UT schedules. After a show has passed, a space request will be submitted for the Francis X. Kinahan (FXK) Theater. If the passed director/proposer opts to propose for a different UT space, Committee may consider this option during the scheduling portion of the quarterly Committee Proposal Meeting. The only reason this may be vetoed is if logistically the Dean’s Men may not have this space. No pro/con or other merit-based discussion of the proposed production will occur in the Committee Proposal Meeting once the show has been passed in the Dean’s Men voting process. If the FXK theater or other desired space is not available, the Dean’s Men will consult Pro-Staff for alternate locations.

The same above holds true for the Spring Quarter production, substituting Logan Courtyard for the FXK. Upholding long-standing University of Chicago tradition, The Dean’s Men will do everything in their power to make this Spring Quarter production an outdoors production, even if it is held in an outdoor location other than Logan Courtyard. Should an excellent case be made in a proposal for an inside Spring show, however, the Dean’s Men may vote for it in their proposal voting process. Should this decision affect space rental fees and therefore budgets, The Dean’s Men will meet with Pro-Staff and Committee prior to the Committee Proposal Meeting to discuss alternate locations and determine the best course of action on a case by case basis.

The Dean’s Men will be allocated a design budget for each production by Pro-Staff in accordance with the UT budgeting process. All box-office proceeds from Dean’s Men shows will be considered UT profit and treated as such. The spring show is traditionally free and will not have box-office proceeds.

During show weekend, the Production Manager will serve as House Manager and cooperate with the UT Front of House Manager assigned to the performance. Board members are subject to ushering duties as needed.

### C. Dean's Men Activities and University Theater

The Dean’s Men retain the right to perform sonnets, collections of scenes, etc. throughout the school year and summer as opportunities arise and as they see fit. The Dean’s Men understand that when they engage in these opportunities they are representing the Shakespeare face of University Theater and will act accordingly.

At all events hosted by The Dean’s Men, members of The Dean’s Men Board should designate multiple individuals to be “event monitors” that are designated beforehand. The contact information of these individuals should be physically posted at the gathering and presented alongside all instances of event advertisement/information (email, Facebook, etc). Event monitors should be aware of their position before the event and available during and after the event for individuals to voice concerns. In addition, a member of Dean’s Men Board should clearly post the University Theater Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct Resource Sheet at the event.

In accordance with University Theater, the Dean’s Men and Dean’s Men shows will follow the Chicago Code of Conduct (CCOC) that University Theater has adopted, and the Dean’s Men Board will attend the PSA and Title IX trainings coordinated by Committee. 


### D. Artistic Autonomy

The Dean’s Men Board retains the right to give respectful input and feedback for Dean’s Men shows as the occasion arises. However, directors for Dean’s Men shows maintain complete artistic autonomy. Directors and designers may make whatever choices they deem fit and use available resources to support their vision for the show, provided that they cause neither emotional nor physical harm. Barring extreme circumstances, individuals working on a Dean’s Men show as a director, designer, actor, or assistant may not accept another position on the same show (e.g. a director may not also be a designer or actor, and the reverse is true).

### E. Membership

Consistent with the inclusive motto of the organization – “Once a Dean’s Man, always a Dean’s Man” – the Dean’s Men membership consists of all individuals who have a show credit on a Dean’s Men production. Show credits include directors, head designers, production managers, stage managers, actors, assistants, and other positions (including board ops and stage hands) at the discretion of the production manager and director. However, Voting Membership shall be limited to members of the Dean’s Men currently enrolled in or working at the University of Chicago.

  1. _Participation_ Any community member who is currently enrolled in or working at the University of Chicago is eligible to participate in a Dean’s Men production and gain membership status. Alumni members are welcome to participate in productions at the discretion of active members.

### F. Board Meetings

Regular Board Meetings are held on a weekly basis in order to discuss the business of the organization. All Board members and the current Dean’s Men director are expected to attend; other delegates from the current Dean’s Men production (such as managers) are encouraged to attend as well. Board Meetings are open to the public. Decisions regarding organization events, activities, and non-production budget are made at Board Meetings through thorough discussion. In certain cases, the Board may choose to put decisions to a vote. In all cases, consensus is sought. The Board will meet in an executive session following the open Board meeting. Other non-Board members can be invited to the executive session at the Board’s discretion. Public Board Meeting minutes are sent out to the Dean’s Men and UT General listhosts following each meeting.

### J. Board Elections

The Board is elected by Voting Members of the organization (as defined in Section 5) at an annual meeting specifically designated as the Board Election Meeting. Said meeting will take place midway through Spring Quarter. Voting takes place for Board positions in the order stated above, starting with the President. Positions may be added, subtracted, and/or altered in response to current organization conditions and requirements as the present Board deems fit. 

An email will be sent out well in advance of the Board Election Meeting calling for people to run for Board positions. To be eligible to run for a Dean’s Men Board position, a Voting Member of the organization must send in a statement of intent, including all of the positions they intend to run for. A Voting Member of the organization may not run for any position on the Dean’s Men Board if they already hold an elected position with another arts leadership body that meets with the Performing Arts Roundtable as well as Iris and CES. At the Board Election meeting, each candidate will present 30-second a brief statement and participate in a two minute question and answer session. The Treasurer will keep time. Once all candidates complete their two-minute question and answer session, all Voting Members will cast their votes by secret ranked ballot. A majority vote is needed to elect a candidate. The current President and Secretary will count votes and announce the results at that time. Then voting for the following positions will go through the same process. On the secret ballot, voters will rank their choices of candidates such that in the event of a tie between two candidates, the tie may be broken by reallocation of the other parties’ votes for other candidates. In the event of a tie after redistribution of votes, a coin will be flipped to determine the winner of the tie. In this case, this information is kept to the Board for confidentiality. 

The new Board takes office during the next academic year, though they shall be trained in their new positions and aid the outgoing Board in the interim. The new Board is expected to attend all Dean’s Men Board meetings after they are elected. The incoming President will be expected to attend Performing Arts Roundtable meetings along with the current President. Terms last for a full academic year. In the event of a midterm vacancy, the relevant Chair will nominate a replacement. The Board will then be responsible for approving that nominee. 

### K. Show Proposals

Any member of the University Community is welcome to propose to direct for the Dean’s Men. Any show may be proposed. All proposals will consist of filling out the proposal form created by the Board. Alterations to this form may be made as necessary to reflect changing values by the Board. Directors do not need staff or sketches to accompany their proposals. However, directors are requested to propose with a space and time in mind, as well as conceptions of their designs for the show. Proposal forms must be submitted by the announced deadline during the Quarter prior to the production. Proposals shall be submitted via email to the Board ([board.shakespeare@lists.uchicago.edu](mailto:board.shakespeare@lists.uchicago.edu)) and in the form of two hardcopies in the Board’s mailbox. At that time, proposers should email the Board listhost with the names of at least three Board members with whom they would like to meet to discuss their proposals.

### L. Selection of Proposals

The Board will determine a meeting time to select a proposal. The Dean’s Men autonomous voting meeting will always occur a week prior to the Committee Proposal Meeting, so that Dean’s Men proposers may propose for other UT spaces than the FXK or Logan Courtyard. The Board will announce the meeting time and distribute copies of proposals to all interested Dean’s Men. Before the proposal meeting proper, all proposers must meet with at least three Board members to discuss their proposals.

At the proposal meeting, proposers will take turns speaking for five minutes about their proposals without any other proposers in the room. They will then take part in a question and answer session, and answer clarifying questions for eight minutes from Voting Members of the Dean’s Men. The Treasurer will keep time. All relevant parties are welcome to come to the proposal meeting and hear the general statements, however, only Voting Members of the Dean’s Men may stay for the question and answer sessions.

Following each question and answer session, directors are asked to leave the room. Once all directors have been questioned, the remaining Voting Members of the Dean’s Men will discuss the proposals and vote by secret ballot. For voting procedure, see Section 8. Dean’s Men members who are not able to attend the proposal meeting may vote for a show of their choice in absentia via email and/or Google Doc, to be managed by the Secretary. These absent voters are expected to read the proposal documents submitted by all directors prior to submitting their vote to the Secretary. They are required to provide at least one show credit for proof of voting, as well as a valid excuse (such as work, illness, class, study abroad, etc.) for their absence.

In the event of a tie in votes between two proposals in a three or more proposal season, the tie will be broken through the ranking ballot system indicated above. In the event of a tie between two proposals in a two proposal season, there will be a second discussion and a re-vote. If there is a second tie between the two proposals, a coin will be flipped to determine the winner of the tie. In this case, this information is kept to the board for confidentiality.  

### M. Non-Production Activities

The Dean’s Men may hold non-production related activities in the UT season. These activities may include but are not limited to publicity events, fundraisers, staged readings, discussion groups, and short performances.

### N. Amendments

At any time, the Board of the Dean’s Men reserves the right to amend or change our bylaws as required by changes in circumstance, opinion, or values. All changes to the bylaws must reach majority vote by the Board and then require ratification by University Theater Committee.
