## II. The Dean's Men

### A. Purpose

Founded in 2006, The Dean's Men is a student organization at the University of Chicago dedicated to the works of William Shakespeare. Through University Theater productions and other activities, we strive to bring the Bard's writing to the school and create a community of theater makers in the process. We are dedicated to this community, which prospers through social events as well as the rehearsal process. As we continue to cultivate and strengthen our art, so we continue to cultivate and strengthen our community. 

In addition to our quarterly University Theater show, we take part in community outreach, engage with academic resources, and participate in other artist and social endeavors. In the past, such endeavors have included directing a yearly Shakespeare show with local middle school students at St. Thomas Academy, organizing bi-weekly play readings, and hosting gatherings with David Bevington, the world-renowned Shakespeare scholar.

Once a Dean's Man, always a Dean's Man

### B. Production Process

The Dean’s Men are guaranteed to perform three shows per year. Once a director and show have been selected for a particular quarter, the Board will assist the director in filling a staff and finding a space, as needed. The selected Dean’s Men show is then submitted to University Theater so that a space and week may be selected with sensitivity to the UT season (see below). The Dean’s Men productions, as UT productions, will fully participate in UT production requirements such as arbitration and space scheduling.

If a show passes the Dean’s Men voting process during Fall or Winter Quarter, this production automatically goes into the Fall or Winter Quarter UT schedules. After a show has passed, a space request will be submitted for the Francis X. Kinahan (FXK) Theater. If the passed director/proposer opts to propose for a different UT space, Committee may consider this option during the scheduling portion of the quarterly Committee Proposal Meeting. The only reason this may be vetoed is if logistically the Dean’s Men may not have this space. No pro/con or other merit-based discussion of the proposed production will occur in the Committee Proposal Meeting once the show has been passed. If the FXK theater or other desired space is not available, the Dean’s Men will consult Pro-Staff for alternate locations.

The same above holds true for the Spring Quarter production, substituting a site specific location for the FXK. Past locations have included Hutchinson Courtyard, Cobb Quad, and Logan Courtyard. Upholding long-standing University of Chicago tradition, The Dean’s Men will do everything in their power to make this Spring Quarter production an outdoor production. Should a case be made in a proposal for an inside Spring show, however, the Dean’s Men may vote for it in their proposal voting process. Should this decision affect space rental fees and therefore budgets, The Dean’s Men will meet with Pro-Staff and Committee prior to the Committee Proposal Meeting to discuss alternate locations and determine the best course of action on a case by case basis. 

Dean’s Men will be allocated a design budget for each production by Pro-Staff in concurrence with the UT show budgets, adjusted for inflation/increase as necessary in addition to the fixed cost budget (covering, primarily, space rental and printing). All box-office proceeds from Dean’s Men shows will be considered UT profit and treated as such. The spring show is traditionally free and will not have box-office proceeds.

During show weekend, board members are subject to ushering duties as needed, as well as staffing the merch table.

### C. Dean's Men Activities and University Theater

The Dean’s Men retain the right to perform sonnets, collections of scenes, etc. throughout the school year and summer as opportunities arise and as they see fit. However, The Dean’s Men understand that when they engage in these opportunities they are representing the Shakespeare face of University Theater and not just themselves and will act accordingly.

At all events hosted by The Dean’s Men, members of The Dean’s Men Board should designate multiple individuals to be “event monitors”. The board will also be responsible for setting up and cleaning up after all events, and take necessary steps to ensure the well being of all attendees during the event.

### D. Artistic Autonomy

The Dean’s Men Board retains the right to give respectful input and feedback for Dean’s Men shows as the occasion arises. However, directors for Dean’s Men shows maintain complete artistic autonomy. Directors and designers may make whatever choices they deem fit and use available resources to support their vision for the show, provided that they cause neither emotional nor physical harm. Barring extreme circumstances, individuals working on a Dean’s Men show as a director, designer, actor, or assistant may not accept another position on the same show (e.g. a director may not also be a designer or actor, and the reverse is true).

### E. Membership

Consistent with the inclusive motto of the organization – “Once a Dean’s Man, always a Dean’s Man” – the Dean’s Men membership consists of all individuals who have a show credit on a Dean’s Men production or Shakespearience. Show credits include directors, head designers, production managers, stage managers, actors, assistants, and other positions (including board ops and stage hands) at the discretion of the production manager and director. However, Voting Membership shall be limited to members of the Dean’s Men currently enrolled in or working at the University of Chicago.

  1. _Participation_ Any community member who is currently enrolled in or working at the University of Chicago is eligible to participate in a Dean’s Men production and gain membership status. Alumni members are welcome to participate in productions at the discretion of active members.

### F. Board Meetings

Regular Board Meetings are held on a weekly basis in order to discuss the business of the organization. All Board members are expected to attend; delegates from the current Dean’s Men production (such as the director and managers) are encouraged to attend as well. Board Meetings are open to the public. Decisions regarding organization events, activities, and non-production budget are made at Board Meetings through thorough discussion. In certain cases, the Board may choose to put decisions to a vote. In all cases, consensus is sought. The Board will meet in an executive session following the open Board meeting. Other non-Board members can be invited to the executive session at the Board’s discretion. Public Board Meeting minutes are sent out to the Dean’s Men listhost following each meeting. Dean’s Men executive session notes should also be sent to the University Theater Committee.

Said meeting will take place in early Spring Quarter. Positions may be added, subtracted, and/or altered in response to current organization conditions and requirements as the present Board deems fit. 

An email will be sent out well in advance of the Board Election Meeting calling for people to run for Board positions. To be eligible to run for a Dean’s Men Board position, a Voting Member of the organization must send in a statement of intent, including all of the positions they intend to run for. A virtual form will be sent out to the Dean’s Men listhost for Voting Members to rank those running for board positions in order of preference.

In the event of a midterm vacancy, the relevant Chair will nominate a replacement. The Board will then be responsible for approving that nominee. 


### K. Show Proposals

Any member of the University Community is welcome to propose to direct for the Dean’s Men. Any show may be proposed with the exception of King Lear. All proposals will consist of filling out the proposal form created by the Board. Alterations to this form may be made as necessary to reflect changing values by the Board. Directors do not need a full staff or sketches to accompany their proposals, but are highly encouraged to reach out to the Board for assistance finding staff members before the proposal meeting. However, directors are requested to propose with a space and time in mind, as well as a general conception of their designs for the show. Proposal forms must be submitted by the announced deadline at the end of Spring quarter for the following academic year. Proposals shall be submitted via email to the Board ([board.shakespeare@lists.uchicago.edu](mailto:board.shakespeare@lists.uchicago.edu)). Proposers should contact at least three Board members with whom they would like to meet to discuss their proposals prior to the proposal deadline.

### L. Selection of Proposals

The Board will determine a meeting time to select a proposal. The Dean’s Men autonomous voting meeting will always occur a week prior to the Committee Proposal Meeting, so that Dean’s Men proposers may propose for other UT spaces than the FXK or a site specific location. The Board will announce the meeting time and distribute copies of proposals to all interested Dean’s Men. Before the proposal meeting proper, all proposers must meet with at least three Board members to discuss their proposals.  

At the proposal meeting, proposers will take turns speaking for five minutes about their proposals. They will then take part in a question and answer session, and answer clarifying questions for five minutes from Voting Members of the Dean’s Men. The President will keep time. All relevant parties are welcome to come to the proposal meeting and hear the general statements, however, only Voting Members of the Dean’s Men may stay for the town hall discussion.

Following each question and answer session, proposers are asked to leave the room. Once all proposers have been questioned, the remaining Voting Members of the Dean’s Men will discuss the proposals and vote by a google form. On the form, voters will rank their choices of show, such that in the event of a tie between two proposers in a three or more proposal season, the tie may be broken by reallocation of the other parties’ votes. Dean’s Men members who are not able to attend the proposal meeting may vote in absentia for 24 hours via a google form sent to the listhost. These absent voters are expected to read the proposal documents submitted by all directors prior to submitting their vote. All are required to provide at least one show credit for proof of voting. 

In the event of a tie in votes between two proposals in a three or more proposal season, the tie will be broken through the ranking ballot system indicated above. In the event of a tie between two proposals in a two proposal season, there will be a second discussion and a re-vote. If there is a second tie between the two proposals, a coin will be flipped to determine the winner of the tie. In this case, this information is kept to the board for confidentiality.  

### M. Finances Non-Production Activities

Dean’s Men Board members should always seek funding for merchandise through the University Theater Committee. Dean’s Men Board members will not use their own funds for the purchase of merchandise unless the following conditions are met: UT Committee and/or pro-staff refuse to provide funding for merchandise; or UT Committee and/or pro-staff do not provide access to funding for merchandise by a necessary date, which must be stated to UT Committee and pro-staff when requesting funding. Should this occur, board members are only permitted to use their own funds for merchandise if they keep receipts of the transaction(s) and provide them to UT and pro-staff for reimbursement.

Dean’s Men social event provisions should always be purchased using funds raised through merchandise sales. Dean’s Men Board members are only to purchase these provisions with their own funds should funds from merchandise sales be inadequate to cover the cost of provisions. Should a board member need to use their own funds to purchase provisions, they are to keep receipts of the transaction(s) and provide them to the Treasurer. The Treasurer is to record all information about the exact amount due to this member in the financial spreadsheet and seek fundraising and/or merchandise sales to reimburse them.

### N. Shakespeariences

The Dean’s Men will hold one to two Shakespeariences per quarter, each quarter. They will typically be held in 3rd and 8th week, unless there is a compelling reason to host in a different week (such as an 8th week mainstage show). Each Shakespearience will consist of a reading of a play by Shakespeare or one of his contemporaries, or a work in conversation with Shakespeare. A $60 snack budget will be provided by University Theater Committee for each Shakespearience. The Education Chair will be responsible for procuring snacks for the event.

The intention of the Shakespeariences is to provide a welcoming, low-commitment way for people to get involved with the Dean’s Men community. This intention should be honored in all decisions made about Shakespeariences in future years, so they remain a way for the Dean’s Men to recruit new members who are unable to participate in mainstage productions.

1. #### Shakespearience Proposal Process: 
    Any member of the University Community is welcome to propose a Shakespearience for the Dean’s Men. Shakespearience Proposals will open on Monday and close on Friday of first and fifth week, for the third and eighth week slots respectively. The proposal process will consist of a google form in which proposers submit the play they wish to read, the number of roles to be read, and their availability during the relevant week. In the instance of multiple proposals, the Dean’s Men Board will exercise their best judgment to determine which proposal will best honor the nature of the Shakespeariences as an opportunity for new people to become involved with the Dean’s Men. This may mean choosing a proposal by someone who has not hosted a Shakespearience before, or is uninvolved in the mainstage production that quarter.

    After the Dean’s Men Board has made their decision, they will notify all proposers. If the decision is for the third-week slot, the Board may decide to offer the eighth-week slot to their second choice vote.
2. #### Institutional Memory Clause:
    Any play by Shakespeare or his contemporaries may be proposed for a Shakespearience, with the exception of plays which were read in a Shakesperience or produced as a mainstage production in the current or past academic year. The intention of this clause is to broaden the scope of plays that the Dean’s Men read, and to promote the reading of less common Shakespeare shows or those by other authors for the Shakespearience series.
3. #### Shakespearience Sign Ups: 
    The sign-up form for each Shakespearience will be sent at least a week before the date. The Education Chair will send the sign-up form template, which the proposer will edit with a description and the list of characters/role divisions for their cut of the script. The form will ask whether participants have a role preference, which the proposer should take into account when assigning roles. The proposer should have roles divided between participants who have signed up in advance of the Shakespearience, but they can wait to inform participants of their roles until the start of the Shakespearience if they wish. 

### O. Non - Production Activities

The Dean’s Men may hold non-production related activities in the UT season. These activities may include but are not limited to publicity events, fundraisers, staged readings, discussion groups, and short performances.

### P. Amendments

At any time, the Board of the Dean’s Men reserves the right to amend or change our bylaws as required by changes in circumstance, opinion, or values. All changes to the bylaws must reach a majority vote by the Board and then require ratification by the University Theater Committee.
