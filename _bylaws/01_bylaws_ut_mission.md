## University Theater's Mission Statement

University Theater provides students with the opportunity to have artistic control of every production aspect of shows presented under the UT banner. University Theater enables members of the University community to explore and practice the many aspects of theater.

UT has four main goals that guide its decision making.

  * **Opportunity:** To provide opportunities for members of the University of Chicago community to present and to experience theater.
  * **Education:** To improve the work we do and to learn from successes and mistakes. Peer mentorship and collaboration with TAPS as a co-curricular program are both means through which we strive to learn and teach. Students need not be a TAPS major to participate in UT, or vice versa.
  * **Artistic Excellence:** To support the artistic achievements in student work.
  * **Community:** To foster a welcoming community—acting as a hub for discourse about theater, facilitating and encouraging connections between student artists, encouraging discussion of future projects, and promoting best practices within and outside of productions.

### General Membership Guidelines

Though membership of UT consists almost entirely of students, the organization is open to all members of the University: students, faculty, staff, and alumni.

Membership shall be open to all interested UChicago Students, regardless of divisional or departmental affiliations, and must comply with the University of Chicago non-discrimination statement.

To be eligible to be a voting member of UT (i.e., to vote on members of Committee) members must have either

  * at least 1 credit in the past 4 quarters - credits include participation in any mainstage play or workshop, and a credit is counted if it is in process the quarter that a vote is taken (that is, a first-time member of any show is eligible to vote the quarter that they participate and all quarters following).
  * Regularly attended one or more production cohorts for a full year

### Hazing

University Theatre will abide by the [University of Chicago’s Anti-Hazing Policy](https://studentmanual.uchicago.edu/university-policies/hazing-policy/#).

### Governing Bodies

University Theater is governed by the UT Student Committee and advised and supported by TAPS Production Staff (Pro-Staff). Additionally, Off-Off Campus and the Dean's Men report to UT committee in the form of a liaison; each organization has its own set of governing guidelines. UT Student Committee also will appoint a liaison to Theater[24], another of its subsidiaries. The by-laws for each of UT’s bodies (UT, Dean’s Men, Off-Off Campus, and Theater[24]) follow.
