## VI. The University Theater Production Regulations

After a production is passed and scheduled by the University Theater Committee, it enters the Production Process. The following elements are not to be taken as the only necessary steps for producing with University Theater.

### A. Auditions

* All auditions will be scheduled at the same time in order to preserve the arbitration process.
* No Actor will be cast in multiple UT productions in any given season.
* #### Structure
  * There will be two days of auditions, usually Tuesday and Wednesday of 1st week.
  * This will be followed by a day of callbacks, usually Thursday of 1st week.
  * After callbacks, there will be pre-arbitration. In pre-arbitration, all directors and stage managers will meet to share ideal cast lists. After this the meeting will end without discussion of resolving conflicted castings.
  * After this, there will be arbitration, presided over by a member of TAPS professional staff. Directors will meet with the professional staff member and discuss conflicts until no actors are cast in multiple productions. The presiding member of professional staff will have final say in resolving disputes.

### B. Cast / Staff

* Once the University Theater season is released, committee and the production teams will coordinate to ensure that only one lead design/management position is held by any given individual.
* Each show must elect a Cast Non-Equity Deputy and a Staff Non-Equity Deputy (Cast and Staff NED) by the end of the second production week, a process facilitated by the Committee Liaison in the absence of the director, stage manager, and production manager. If possible, these positions should be held by individuals who have participated in at least one previous University Theater production. The responsibilities of the Cast and Staff NEDs include the following:

    * Communicating and advocating on behalf of the cast and staff to the stage manager, production manager, and/or the Committee Liaison when their attention is brought to a conflict or concern that cannot be mediated between the complainants themselves. Unless anonymity is explicitly waived, the identities of the complainants must be anonymous.
    * Meeting with the Committee Liaison at least once every two weeks to facilitate communication and bring up any concerns to the Committee Liaison.
    * For the staff NED, making every human attempt to attend all scheduled production meetings.

### C. Rehearsal and Fight / Intimacy Choreography

* No fight or intimacy work will occur in UT that has not been approved by a professional choreographer. Any production that desires fight or intimacy work will work with TAPS professional staff to hire a professional fight or intimacy choreographer.
* A production’s committee liaison should make every human effort to be present for fight choreography rehearsals.

### C. Removal of an individual from a production by committee

* As the governing body of UT, committee is responsible for ensuring that the standards set in this document are met by all community members. As such, committee reserves the right to remove individuals from productions via a two-thirds majority vote.
* Committee should make every effort to ascertain the details of the situation before calling a vote for removal in this way.

### D. Post-mort

* After a production has closed, the committee chair will arrange for both an in-person post-mort where the process can be discussed and an anonymous online form for the same. If the committee chair was a part of the production, the treasurer will run the post-mort. If both the chair and the treasurer were part of the production, then the secretary will run the post-mort. If all three aforementioned Executive Board members were part of the production, the social chair will run the post-mort. If all of the Executive Board was a part of the production, the committee liaison will run the post mort.
