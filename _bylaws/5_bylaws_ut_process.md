## VI. The University Theater Production Process

After a production is passed and scheduled by the University Theater Committee, it enters the Production Process. The following elements are not to be taken as the only necessary steps for producing with University Theater.

### A. Pre-Production Quarter

* Once the University Theater season is released, Committee and the production teams will coordinate to ensure that only one lead design/management position is held by any given individual.
* Once production teams are finalized, they work with TAPS production staff to fully realize design visions and determine budgets that are within the specified ranges.
* By the time of the Uber Production Meeting, production teams will finalize budgets. These budgets will be presented at the Uber Production Meeting, after which TAPS production staff and UT Committee will determine exact final budgets.
* All auditions will be scheduled at the same time in order to preserve the arbitration process.

### B. Production Quarter

* No Actor will be cast in multiple UT productions in any given season.
* There will be two days of auditions, usually Tuesday and Wednesday of 1st week.
* This will be followed by a day of callbacks, usually Thursday of 1st week.
* No fight or intimacy work will occur in UT that has not been approved by a professional choreographer. Any production that desires fight or intimacy work will work with TAPS professional staff to hire a professional fight or intimacy choreographer.
* A production’s committee liaison should make every human effort to be present for fight choreography rehearsals.
* Each show must elect a Cast Non-Equity Deputy and a Staff Non-Equity Deputy (Cast and Staff NED) by the end of the second production week, a process facilitated by the Committee Liaison in the absence of the director, stage manager, and production manager. If possible, these positions should be held by individuals who have participated in at least one previous University Theater production. The responsibilities of the Cast and Staff NEDs include the following:

    * Communicating and advocating on behalf of the cast and staff to the stage manager, production manager, and/or the Committee Liaison when their attention is brought to a conflict or concern that cannot be mediated between the complainants themselves. Unless anonymity is explicitly waived, the identities of the complainants must be anonymous.
    * Meeting with the Committee Liaison at least once every two weeks to facilitate communication and bring up any concerns to the Committee Liaison.
    * For the staff NED, making every human attempt to attend all scheduled production meetings.

### C. Casting Arbitration

* All of UT’s mainstage shows are given equal status and standing with each other. To that end, UT has several policies in place to help promote fair and equitable access to acting talent during the casting process.
* Auditions and callbacks for all mainstages casting in each quarter must occur at the same time.
* No show has inherent priority to cast any actor for any reason.

    * This includes the actor’s preference for casting if they are auditioning for multiple shows.  Actor preference never has any bearing on the casting process, and casting teams should not inquire about this information.

* After callback auditions, an arbitration meeting with a member of Pro Staff must occur before the release of cast lists.  All casting teams bring a proposed cast list to this meeting, and if actors appear on multiple lists, these conflicts are discussed, and lists are modified until each actor only appears in one show.

    * Pro Staff oversees arbitration to ensure the fairest resolution of disputes.  If casting teams cannot come to a mutual agreement regarding a conflict, the Pro Staff member will have final and absolute authority to decide on an outcome.
    * Casting teams are strongly encouraged to bring multiple alternative actors they are comfortable casting for each role to arbitration in the event they must give their top choice to another show.  Callbacks are an ideal time to identify these options.
    * The arbitration meeting cannot end until all cast lists are finalized with all roles filled.  No alterations are permitted to cast lists decided at arbitration except in the case of a role being declined.

* After arbitration is complete, casting teams should coordinate to release the cast lists decided at arbitration together.  Each full cast list must be released to cast actors at the same time.
* An actor can only receive ONE casting offer during a UT mainstage season.  The actor may choose to decline this offer for any reason; however, it is with the understanding that they will not receive another casting offer for a UT mainstage that season.

    * If a role is declined or if an actor leaves a show, casting directors may fill the role with any UT-eligible actor that has not already been offered a role during this UT mainstage season.  Additional auditions may or may not be held to fill this role.

* Before auditions begin, each show should have equal access to each actor auditioning for multiple shows, and each actor should have equal chances of booking roles they are eligible to be cast in.  Any communication from casting teams that impacts (a) casting of other shows or (b) casting of other individual actors is strictly prohibited at any time prior to or during casting.  Select examples include:

    * Indicating a certain actor will be cast in a show/role if they audition
    * Explicitly encouraging actors not to audition for other shows
    * Telling an actor to decline a callback because they are wanted for a different show
    * Negotiating with other casting teams outside of arbitration

* Engaging in this type of communication or otherwise breaching this casting arbitration bylaw will result in sanctions for that production—including, but not limited to:

    * Automatic rejection of a proposal
    * Removal of personnel from a production
    * Reduction of funding for a production
    * Cancellation of a production

### D. Removal of an individual from a production by Committee

* As the governing body of UT, Committee is responsible for ensuring that the standards set in this document are met by all community members. As such, committee reserves the right to remove individuals from productions via a two-thirds majority vote.
* Committee should make every effort to ascertain the details of the situation before calling a vote for removal in this way.

### E. Post-mort

* After a production has closed, the committee chair will arrange for both an in-person post-mort where the process can be discussed and an anonymous online form for the same. If the committee chair was a part of the production, the treasurer will run the post-mort. If both the chair and the treasurer were part of the production, then the secretary will run the post-mort. If all three aforementioned Executive Board members were part of the production, the social chair will run the post-mort. If all of the Executive Board was a part of the production, the committee liaison will run the post mort.
