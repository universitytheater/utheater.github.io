## VI. The University Theater Production Process

After a production is passed and scheduled by the University Theater Committee, it enters the Production Process.

### A. Pre-Production Quarter

* Once the UT season is released, Committee and the production teams will coordinate to ensure that only one lead directing/design/management position is held by any given individual on shows that perform in the same quarter and/or have rehearsal schedules that overlap for more than two weeks. Any member who would like to work on multiple shows that have overlapping rehearsal schedules must fill out the Additional Position Application subject to Committee approval.

* Once production teams are finalized, they work with TAPS Pro-staff to fully realize design visions and determine budgets that are within the specified ranges. The entire production team of each show will meet with TAPS Pro-Staff in two different formats in the pre-production quarter. The first will be through the design conference. The design conference will occur in the 6th week of the pre-production quarter. For fall shows this will be just one week after the show is passed. Teams are not expected to have final designs ready by this point. Each production team member should provide an overview of their ideas and field feedback from TAPS Pro-Staff. The second meeting will be the Uber Production Meeting. This will take place during the 8th or 9th week of the pre-production quarter. Each production staff member should have much more fleshed out ideas by this point. Team members should also meet with their TAPS Pro-Staff mentor in between the two meetings to finalize their ideas. 

* By the time of the Uber Production Meeting, production teams should  finalize their budgets. Each team member should send the Production Manager their requested budget and the Production Manager will finalize the complete budget. Team members should discuss their personal budgetary needs with their TAPS Pro-Staff member prior to reporting their request to the Production Manager.  These budgets will be presented at the Uber Production Meeting, after which TAPS Pro-staff and Committee will determine exact final budgets.

* All auditions will be scheduled at the same time in order to preserve the arbitration process. Directors, managers, or other production team members may not field auditions in any capacity outside of those approved and scheduled by Committee. 


### B. Production Quarter

* No actor will be cast in multiple UT productions with more than two weeks of overlapping rehearsal.
* Directors and stage managers will have to provide Committee with their audition materials in the weeks prior to the audition process. Shows can ask auditionees to prepare sides, experts of songs, participate in a dance call, or perform improv. Auditionees may not be asked to perform fight or intimacy work in the audition. All auditionees will be asked about their comfort level with fight or intimacy work, if cast.   
* There will be two days of auditions, usually Tuesday and Wednesday of 1st week.
* This will be followed by a day of callbacks, usually Thursday of 1st week.
* No fight or intimacy work will occur in UT that has not been approved by a professional choreographer. Any production that desires fight or intimacy work will work with TAPS professional staff to hire a professional fight or intimacy choreographer.
* A production’s Committee Liaison should make every human effort to be present for fight choreography rehearsals. If the Liaison cannot attend for any reason, another member of the committee must be selected to attend the rehearsal. 
* Each show must elect a Cast Non-Equity Deputy and a Staff Non-Equity Deputy (Cast and Staff NED) by the end of the second production week, a process facilitated by the Committee Liaison in the absence of the lead director, stage manager, and production manager. If possible, these positions should be held by individuals who have participated in at least one previous University Theater production. The responsibilities of the Cast and Staff NEDs include the following:

    * Communicating and advocating on behalf of the cast and staff to the stage manager, production manager, and/or the Committee Liaison when their attention is brought to a conflict or concern that cannot be mediated between the complainants themselves. Unless anonymity is explicitly waived, the identities of the complainants must be anonymous.
    * Meeting with the Committee Liaison at least once every two weeks to facilitate communication and bring up any concerns to the Committee Liaison.
    * For the staff NED, making every human attempt to attend all scheduled production meetings.

### C. Casting Arbitration

* All of UT’s mainstage shows are given equal status and standing with each other. To that end, UT has several policies in place to help promote fair and equitable access to acting talent during the casting process.
* Auditions and callbacks for all mainstages, workshops, and Off-Off generation casting in each quarter (if applicable) must occur at the same time.
* No show has inherent priority to cast any actor for any reason.

    * This includes the actor’s preference for casting if they are auditioning for multiple shows.  Actor preference never has any bearing on the casting process, and casting teams should not inquire about this information.
    * Off-Off Campus does have inherent priority in casting, and must send their new members after Fall auditions to UT Chair for consideration in arbitration.

*  _Auditions Communication_. Before auditions begin, each show should have equal access to each actor auditioning for multiple shows, and each actor should have equal chances of booking roles they are eligible to be cast in. Any communication from casting teams that impacts (a) casting of other shows or (b) casting of other individual actors is strictly prohibited at any time prior to or during casting. Select examples include:

    * Indicating a certain actor will be cast in a show/role if they audition.
    * Explicitly encouraging actors not to audition for other shows.
    * Telling an actor to decline a callback because they are wanted for a different show.
    * Negotiating with other casting teams outside of arbitration.

*  _Callback Scheduling_. After general auditions end, a callback scheduling meeting with a member of UT Committee is held to ensure that no actor that is called back has conflicts in their callback schedule.

    * At least one member from the direction or management team of each mainstage and workshop that is holding callback auditions must attend the meeting. If Off-Off is casting during the current quarter, they must also attend the meeting.
    * The UT Committee member overseeing the callback scheduling meeting cannot be auditioning nor on the direction or management team of any UT show in the quarter. If no available Committee member fulfills this criteria, the UT Chair oversees the callback scheduling meeting.
    * At the beginning of the meeting, all teams list the actors they intend to call back, and overlapping actors are noted.
    * Each UT mainstage is given one hour of callback auditions (“power hour”), in which they are allowed to freely schedule callbacks and have priority over other shows. The timeframe of each power hour is assigned at random, and workshops and Off-Off are not allotted power hours. The goal of power hour is to schedule actors that other shows also intend to call back and minimize scheduling conflicts.
    * After each power hour is scheduled and shared with other teams, all teams schedule their remaining callback auditions. Additional scheduling conflicts that arise are arbitrated between casting teams, with the member of UT Committee having the final say if teams cannot come to a mutual agreement.
    * The callback meeting cannot end until all overlapping actors are scheduled. No show may modify their callback schedule to include actors that they did not list during the meeting, though they may remove actors from their callback schedule and modify the callback schedules of actors that do not overlap with other teams’ callbacks.
    * After the callback scheduling meeting is complete, all casting teams must release their callback schedules via email at a coordinated time.


*  _Casting Arbitration_.  After callback auditions, an arbitration meeting with a member of Pro Staff must occur before the release of cast lists. All casting teams bring a proposed cast list to this meeting, and if actors appear on multiple lists, these conflicts are discussed, and lists are modified until each actor only appears in one show.

    * Pro Staff oversees arbitration to ensure the fairest resolution of disputes. If casting teams cannot come to a mutual agreement regarding a conflict, the Pro Staff member will have final and absolute authority to decide on an outcome.
    * Casting teams are required to bring multiple alternative actors they are comfortable casting for each role to arbitration in the event they must give their top choice to another show. Callbacks are an ideal time to identify these options.
    * The arbitration meeting begins with all mainstage teams arbitrating. If workshops are being produced in the current quarter, the mainstage teams send their cast lists to workshop teams immediately after mainstage cast lists are free of conflicts. Workshop teams then arbitrate, and conflicts are resolved between workshop cast lists.
    * The arbitration meeting cannot end until all cast lists are finalized with all roles filled. No alterations are permitted to cast lists decided at arbitration except in the case of a role being declined.
    * After arbitration is complete, casting teams should coordinate to release the cast lists decided at arbitration together. Teams may choose to either send the full cast list to all who auditioned, or send individual offers to those who have been cast. Once all roles have been confirmed by the actor, all those who auditioned will get a confirmation that they have not been cast.  

*  _Casting Offers_.  An actor can only receive ONE casting offer during a UT mainstage season. The actor may choose to decline this offer for any reason; however, it is with the understanding that they will not receive another casting offer for a UT mainstage or workshop that season.
    * If a role is declined or if an actor leaves a show, casting directors may fill the role with any UT-eligible actor that has not already been offered a role during this UT season. Additional auditions may or may not be held to fill this role.

### D. Bylaw Violation Sanctons

* As the governing body of UT, Committee is responsible for ensuring that the standards set in Section VI of the Bylaws are met by all community members. As such, breaching Section VI will result in sanctions for a production, including, but not limited to:
    * Automatic rejection of a proposal.
    * Removal of personnel from a production.
    * Reduction of funding from a production.
    * Cancellation of a production.

* Sanctions for breaching Section VI may only be enacted with a two-thirds majority vote from Committee.

* Committee should make every effort to ascertain the details of the situation before calling a vote for sanctions in this way.

### E. Post-mort

* After a production has closed, the Committee Chair will arrange for both an in-person post-mort where the process can be discussed and an anonymous online form for the same. If the Committee Chair was a part of the production, the Treasurer will run the post-mort. If both the Chair and the Treasurer were part of the production, then the Secretary will run the post-mort. If all three aforementioned Executive Board members were part of the production, the Social Chair will run the post-mort. If the Social Chair was also part of the production, the Outreach Chair will run the post-mort. If all of the officers were a part of the production, the Committee Liaison will run the post mort.
