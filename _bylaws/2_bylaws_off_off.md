## III. Off-Off Campus

Off-Off Campus, University Theater’s improvisational comedy troupe, was founded in 1986 by Frank Kinahan, Bernie Sahlins, Steve Schroer, and a number of students. Each Fall, Winter, and Spring Quarter, Off-Off Campus performs a new comedy revue consisting of five Friday night shows (4th through 8th Week) at the Blue Gargoyle Theater in University Church. The Revues consist of original sketches and long and short form improvisation, directed, written, and performed by the members of Off-Off Campus. Off-Off also performs a summer season (length and dates vary) in the Logan Center for the Arts, and performs a variety of special shows including the “O-Week Show” in Mandel Hall.

Like any other UT Mainstage show, the costs associated with the production are covered by ticket sales. And, like any other UT show any profit made is used for the benefit of the entire organization; this includes upkeep of spaces, general publicity, props, competition fees, etc. However, unlike any other UT Mainstage show, the UT Committee does not control Off-Off-Campus' schedule.

Herein, Off-Off Campus may be referred to as "Off-Off" or "OOC" for brevity's sake.

### A. Membership, Business Meetings, and Voting

1. #### Membership
    *   ##### Membership Status

        * Off-Off Campus Membership is based on a Generational system. Each member of Off-Off Campus belongs to a Generation, comprised of the cohort cast at the beginning of the academic year. The 1st Generation was cast in 1986, the 2nd in 1987, etc. No member may change Generations. Off-Off Membership is brokeninto two categories: Active Members and Alumni.

            * _Active Members_. All collegiate members of Off-Off Campus are given Active Status. A generation and its members has active status for four consecutive years. If a member graduates or leaves the College prior to their Generation completing those four years, then that member’s status changes from Active to Alumni.


            * _Alumni_. All graduated members of Off-Off Campus, or members of Off-Off Campus whose generations have graduated, are given Alumni status. Alumni are welcome to come back and perform/ direct at the discretion of the current active members.
        * In the rare case that a member of OOC needs to be removed, active members of the group must be notified 2 weeks in advance that the next business meeting will include a vote to remove a member(s) from the group. The Production Manager must approve any request for a vote to remove a member. A vote of 3/4 of those present is necessary to take away a person’s membership status.

    * ##### Performing Generation

        * After being cast in Off-Off Campus (See Audition Procedure, section III.B.3), the New Generation must undergo 2 consecutive quarters of training (see Training the New Generation, section III.D.1). The New Generation may not participate in other Off-Off shows or competitions during this time.
        * Directly following the 2 quarters of training, the New Generation becomes the Performing Generation.
        * The Performing Generation performs 2 Consecutive Revues (Spring and Fall), selects their directors, is the creative face of Off-Off for the duration of their time as the Performing Generation. The Performing Generation has first priority for any extra performances and other opportunities that arise during their tenure as Performing Generation, provided they do not conflict with the Revue rehearsal and performance schedule.
        * After completing 2 consecutive quarters of training followed by 2 consecutive Revues, the Generation forfeits the title of “Performing Generation” and rejoins the ranks of Active Off-Off Members.

2. #### Business Meetings
    * Regular Business Meetings are held for the purpose of both organization governance and information distribution. Business meeting are chaired by the PM with the APM acting as secretary. The Production Manager is responsible for communication regarding the scheduling and location of business meetings.

        * To keep all members informed of areas concerned with production and finances;
        * To elect the APM, Publicity Coordinator, UT Liaison, and Casting Committee (Spring);

        * To hold Post Mortem of the Quarter's events and performances.




    * ##### Scheduling
      In addition to the Business Meetings laid out above, any member of Off-Off may call a business meeting by contacting the Production Manager.
