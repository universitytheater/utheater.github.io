title: Romeo and Juliet
slug: romeo-juliet
subheader: "written by William Shakespeare

  directed by Emily O'Heir

  Spring 2022"
description: "Two families, two lovers, and a hatred so old that no one remembers its cause. Defying the barriers forged from their families’ enmity, Romeo and Juliet challenge their community by risking everything for love. Shakespeare sets his immortal tale against a community uprooted by conflict—as resonant today as it was 400 years ago. Moved by mutual infatuation and desire for a new life, Romeo and Juliet dare to pursue a reality where hearts are not ruled by hatred."
