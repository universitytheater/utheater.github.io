title: Marian, or the True Tale of Robin Hood
slug: marian
subheader: "written by Adam Szymkowicz

  directed by June Villers

  Fall 2022"
description: "A gender-bending, patriarchy-smashing, hilarious new take on the classic tale. Robin Hood is (and has always been) Maid Marian in disguise, and leads a motley group of Merry Men (few of whom are actually men) against the greedy Prince John. As the poor get poorer and the rich get richer, who will stand for the vulnerable if not Robin? What is the cost of revealing your true self in a time of trouble? Modern concerns and romantic entanglements clash on the battlefield and on the ramparts of Nottingham Castle. A play about selfishness and selflessness and love deferred and the fight. Always the fight. The fight must go on."

  - name: TianTian Xu
    role: Sir Theo the Punctual/Tanner

He’s previously worked on *Waiting for Godot* (Assistant Sound Designer), *Welcome Back to My Channel* (Assistant Production Manager) and *Love's Labour's Lost* (Production Manager).
