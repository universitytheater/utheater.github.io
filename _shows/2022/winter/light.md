description: 'Not every marriage proposal goes as planned. Loy A. Webb’s <em>The Light</em> introduces us to Rashad and Genesis on what should be one of the happiest days of their lives, but their joy quickly unravels when ground-shifting accusations from the past resurface in this gripping two-character drama. Can their relationship survive the growing divide between them over who – and what – to believe? <em>The Light</em> is a reckoning that unfolds in real-time and peels away the layers of truth, doubt, pain, and, ultimately, the power of love.
