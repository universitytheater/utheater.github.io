description: 'The Frau used to direct beautiful films for a fascist government. Now she’s trying to make a film that’s simply beautiful. But when telegrams start to arrive from the Minister of Propaganda, The Frau can no longer ignore the real war outside her sound stage. A darkly comical look at the role of artists during wartime, inspired by the life and work of Leni Riefenstahl.
