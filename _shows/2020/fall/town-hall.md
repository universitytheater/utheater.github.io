description: Eco-Feminism. Citizenship. Democracy. Human Relationships. A play about the times in which we live, a piece of theatre about being an audience, and an epic, intimate work about what we could do to change the world. <em>Town Hall</em> is part play, part dream, part meeting, part imagining a future in which new ways of connecting must be found…. a group of barely connected people comes together, feeling their way towards… connection? <em>Town Hall</em> explores how are we “us” in a room? In a theatre?
