    <h5>Summaries</h5>
    <p>“Paris and Troilus, you have both said well” from <em>Troilus and Cressida</em> was originally delivered by Hector to his brothers Paris and Troilus to explain his position on the Trojan war. It describes why it was wrong for Paris to spirit off Helen, another man’s wife, and yet, in the monologue’s final moments, Hector urges a rededication to the resulting war, whatever its origin. What do we do with a wayward wife?</p>
    <p>“And I, forsooth, in love!” from <em>Love’s Labour Lost</em> was originally delivered by Biron, a man who had agreed with his companions to swear off women for three years so they could focus on their studies, yet who nevertheless finds himself enamored with the witty Rosaline. The monologue contains his lovestruck concerns about love and his beloved. What are vows before love?</p>
    <p>“They shall go forward, Kate” from <em>The Taming of the Shrew</em> was originally delivered by Petruchio to his fiancée Kate and a crowd, giving orders and assurances about their upcoming marriage. He further describes Kate as his property, and, for that reason, subject to his protection. What does this patriarchal attitude about marriage suggest about the reciprocity of its demands?</p>
    <p>“Was the hope drunk/wherein you dressed yourself” from <em>Macbeth</em> was originally not a monologue, but a dialogue between Lady Macbeth and her husband. In it, Lady Macbeth exhorts her husband to more vigorously pursue kingship, mocking him as a coward and unmanly. Do husbands owe their wives power, and what should wives do to make sure they get it?</p>
    <p>“Say ‘a day’ without the ‘ever.’” from <em>As You Like It</em> was originally delivered by Rosalind as part of her exchange of wedding vows with her new husband Orlando. It’s a reminder, following his declaration of undying love, that the honeymoon period will end, her less endearing features will emerge, and they will still be married. If not feeling, whence come the obligations of marriage?</p>
    <p>“Sir, I desire you do me right and justice” from <em>Henry VIII</em> was originally delivered by Katherine, then Queen of England, to King Henry VIII between hearing of his plans to have their marriage annulled and the plan’s eventual execution. In it, she pleads her case, explaining the ways in which she has been a good wife, the legality of their marriage, and the durability of wedlock. What should end a marriage?</p>"

    <h5>Summaries</h5>
    <p>Queen Margaret tortures the Duke of York for trying to a) steal the throne from her husband and b) then insisting on being declared heir, thereby stealing the throne from her son. She uses her henchmen, the lords of Clifford and Northumberland, to kill one of York’s sons and to threaten the others. </p>
    <p>Philip, the bastard son of Richard the Lionhearted, has just been given knighthood in exchange for giving up his inheritance. In this monologue, he revels in his new status, and considers how he will have to change the way he acts around others.</p>
    <p>King John is about to lose everything, as all his impulsive actions catch up to him. King John had ordered the child Arthur’s death because the child had a claim to the throne, and King John has spent the entire play trying desperately to cling onto his kingdom.  When he sees that his nobles, his people, and even nature itself are appalled by his ordering the death of a child, he tries to push all the blame onto his henchman Hubert, whom he had ordered to kill Arthur. </p>
    <p>In the beginning of Act 4 of <em>Henry V</em>, the chorus brings us back from watching the French gleefully prepare to slaughter the English in battle. We are in the middle of a battlefield, around 3 a.m., just hours before the battle of Agincourt, which both the English and the French are convinced the English will lose. However, as the chorus tells us, King Henry V is going to spend his last few hours before the battle encouraging his men and convincing them that he’s one of them. </p>

    <p>Only months after Lady Percy lost her husband, Harry Percy, in battle, his father tries to go off and fight in the new rebellion. Lord Northumberland, her father-in-law, is the only protection Lady Percy has left, so she is terrified. Even worse, Northumberland could have marched to defend Percy in battle, but he didn’t, and now Percy is dead. She tries to remind Northumberland that his son wasn’t called Hotspur for no reason--he was an incredible warrior and a loving husband. </p>"
