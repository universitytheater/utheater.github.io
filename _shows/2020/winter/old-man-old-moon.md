description: "<p>The Old Man, whose job is to refill the moon with light every night,\
  \ has his world rocked when his wife leaves him in search of a lost melody from\
  \ their past. Forced out of his complacent lifestyle, the Old Man abandons his duty\
  \ and sets off on a journey to the end of the world to find her. In the style of\
  \ Celtic folklore and British sea shanties, the Old Man encounters obstacles beyond\
  \ your wildest imagination.</p><h4 class=\"mt-2 mb-2\">Cast</h4> <p><strong>Dara\
