description: '<p>The Old Man, whose job is to refill the moon with light every night,
  has his world rocked when his wife leaves him in search of a lost melody from their
  past. Forced out of his complacent lifestyle, the Old Man abandons his duty and
  sets off on a journey to the end of the world to find her. In the style of Celtic
  folklore and British sea shanties, the Old Man encounters obstacles beyond your
  wildest imagination.</p><h4 class="mt-2 mb-2">Cast</h4> <p><strong>Dara Weinstein</strong> (Mabelu/Butcher)
