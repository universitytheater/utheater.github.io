  \ follows two men, Vladimir and Estragon, who meet at a tree where they wait for\

  \ bond as they discuss the world\u2019s truths, suicide, religion, and their purpose\
  \ on this planet.</p><p><em>Content Warning: Waiting For Godot contains references\
  \ to death and suicide, representations of slavery, and frequent use of static,\
