title: The Taming of the Shrew
slug: taming-shrew
subheader: "written by William Shakespeare

  directed by Alex Nobert

  Fall 2023"
description: "Upsilon Delta Mu puts on their annual production of Shakespeare’s energetic, boisterous comedy. A farcical battle of wits between two headstrong figures, the play follows the transformation of Katherina, an assertive woman deemed aggressive and violent by those around her. Watch as the world of 16th century Italian marital dynamics blends with the modern fraternity and the tropes found 400 years ago strike a nerve today."

roles:
  Cast:
  - name: Sanjna Narayan
    role: Katherine
    bio: is a fourth-year student majoring in Public Policy with a specialization in Economics and minoring in Theater. Favorite past credits include The SQUIP (*Be More Chill*), Hermia (*A Midsummer Night's Dream*), Audrey II (*Little Shop of Horrors*), Edwin Drood (*The Mystery of Edwin Drood*), and Witch I (*MacBeth*). She is so thrilled to be back in the world of Shakespeare, and cannot thank her family, friends, crew, and castmates enough for all of their constant support and encouragement! While she doesn't frequent frats, Sanjna's "party persona" is definitely the one to fall asleep first.
  - name: Jonathan Rufino
    role: Petruchio
    bio: is a fourth-year Physics major. Previous credits, all with the Dean's Men, include *Macbeth* (Macduff, Winter 2019), *Twelfth Night* (Sir Andrew Aguecheek, Spring 2019), *Much Ado About Monologues* (King John, Autumn 2020), *Love's Labour's Lost* (Ferdinand, Autumn 2021), *King Lear* (King Lear, Spring 2022), *Romeo and Juliet* (Capulet, Autumn 2022), *Macbeth* (Ross, Winter 2023), and *Twelfth Night* (Orsino, Spring 2023). Given his history of playing awful people, he's excited to present you with potentially the worst one yet, and will, as always, remind you that in real life he is naught but a silly little guy. Enjoy the show!
  - name: Sophie Knifton
    role: Bianca
    bio: is a fourth-year in the College majoring in Psychology & Gender and Sexuality Studies. Her previous Dean’s Men credits include *Macbeth* (Third Witch) and *Love’s Labour’s Lost* (Jaquenetta/Maria). Her fratsona is Baileigh, and yes, she will spell it out for the Starbucks barista. Enjoy the show!
  - name: Charlotte Manier
    role: Lucentio
    bio: "has goofed and gaffed in many roles over the last year: a 45-year-old woman (Nurse in *Romeo & Juliet*), a fungus hive-mind alien (Witch 1 in *Macbeth in Space*), and a dictator (Co-Director of *Twelfth Night*). Her smaller roles include biology major and law, letters, and society major. Now she faces her hardest role yet: a man. Who knew her first drag performance would be as a frat boy? Not her! Now, SHUT THEFUCKUP, feast with the best, and WELCOME TO MY HOUSE!!!!"
  - name: Joseph DePaula
    role: Grumio
    bio:  is a 2nd-year Medieval Studies major here at the university. On top of his recent acting credits—-*Dead Fun Society* (UT, Mark Hellebrand), *The Physicists* (CoT, Sievers/McArthur/Murillo/Guhl/Blocher/Police Doctor), and *Marian, or the True Tale of Robin Hood* (UT, Little John)—he is also Events Manager for Cup of Theater and the Production Manager/Co-Outreach Coordinator for Attori Senza Paura (the Commedia dell'Arte troupe on campus). His Commedia mask is Il Dottore. Joseph was last seen walking into the center of the C-Bench in front of Cobb Hall and vanishing completely out-of-sight. His "fratsona," Duncan, is a ΥΔΜ pledge. Duncan—the fratsona—thought it would be funny to replace the “Y” in the “BOYER” sign with the "N" from the "D-NIK" sign so the Campus North windows would read "DIK BONER."
  - name: Giancarlo Beritela
    role: Baptista
    bio: is a second-year Economics and Romance Languages major, and a proud Dean's Man. He has previously worked *Romeo and Juliet* (Benvolio) and student-written improv show *Dead Fun Society* (Chase von Meyer). His "fratsona" if you will, Brayden, is a well-intentioned young man, leading his life as risk manager of Upsilon Delta Mu. He likes the mustard without the beef, "for that goes hard," so he says. 
  - name: Nora Schultz
    role: Hortensio
    bio: is a fourth-year studying English and Gender & Sexuality Studies as well as the Secretary of the Dean's Men. She's beginning to question whether she might bring a certain "pathetic loser man" vibe to the Dean's Men, since her last turn upon the stage was in Autumn 2021's *Love's Labour's Lost*, where she appeared as the hopelessly lovestruck Dumaine. Nora also served on the direction team for last winter's *Macbeth in Space*, and is thrilled to be sharing the director's chair once more next quarter with Honor in a very Victorian-does-medieval production of *Richard III* while frantically hammering out a thesis on masculinity in Shakespeare's history plays between scenes. Her fratsona is George, the vice president of Upsilon Delta Mu, who has spent the last several years triangulating homoerotic desire with the rest of the boys, Eve Sedgwick's "Between Men" style.
  - name: Lauren Sklarz
    role: Gremio/Widow
    bio: "is a second-year undergraduate at the university majoring in Creative Writing and Economics. This is her third consecutive show cross-dressing. She is so proud of the entire cast and crew of Taming Night and hopes you enjoy the show!"
  - name: Honor Torrance
    role: Tranio
    bio: is a fourth-year studying English and Cinema & Media Studies, and the current Dean's Men Arts Chair. She's starting to wonder if maybe she brings a certain "conniving servant" kind of vibe to the Dean's Men, having most recently appeared plotting and scheming and causing problems on purpose as Maria in last spring's production of *Twelfth Night*. It's rumored that next quarter will be "the winter of [Honor's] discontent", as she'll be co-directing *Richard III* with Nora while simultaneously cranking out a thesis on Victorian bodily anxieties. Nobody knows anything about Honor's fratsona--he's suspicious and elusive, may or may not be behind the mysterious disappearance of multiple irreplaceable frat house heirlooms, and every time he's addressed out loud by name the speaker is conveniently drowned out by a very loud passing vehicle.
  - name: Ruth Witter
    role: Vincentio/Curtis
    bio: is a first year prospective Linguistics major. They've never been in a theater production or a frat house before, so this show has been a host of new experiences for them.
  - name: Dallas Wolf
    role: Merchant/Tailor/Servant
    bio: is a third-year Economics major. This is his first show with University Theater! Dallas enjoys long walks on the beach, a toasty mocha to start the day, and incessantly talking about space.
  Production Staff:
  - name: Alex Nobert
    role: Director
    bio: is a fourth-year Environmental Science and History major. She has been a part of many productions in UT, and is grateful to finally direct the Dean's Men production she has been ranting about since even before she was a Dean's Man. She hopes everyone absolutely enjoys this show, significantly those who relate especially to Katherina. She also wants it to be very known how earth shatteringly grateful she is to all the cast and crew who brought this idea to life. It's not a competition (obviously), but she does believe she is the veriest shrew of them all.
  - name: Coco Liu
    role: Production Manager
    bio:

She is so happy to have experienced her first Dean’s Men rehearsal room and thankful to have staged managed for Alex, who acted in her last show as an SM and has always been an accident/incident report waiting to happen. Here’s to the brothers!

Previous to this production of *The Taming of the Shrew*, Laura Tutondele worked with Ellen MacKay on the Beshrew Me!, a project that seeks to digitize *The Taming of the Shrew* in all its details and complications through the OCHRE database, with a focus on the non-semantic elements.
