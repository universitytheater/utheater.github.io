      role: Director
      bio: is a third-year Psychology major and only does theater as a hobby because she has a deep-seated dislike of theater kids (yes, that includes herself). They wrote this play because their name is Kassandra (wow narcissist much?) and they're super excited/nervous for people to see it. They'd like to thank their cast for watching 50% off, even though it has nothing to do with this show, and they'd like to thank the Greek gods for being chaotic and awful most of the time (also, no she's never read Percy Jackson). Anyway, enjoy the show :)
