title: The Laramie Project
slug: laramie-project
subheader: "written by Moisés Kaufman and the members of the Tectonic Theater Project

  directed by Billy DeVito

  Winter 2023"
description: "The Laramie Project presents a deeply complex portrait of a community’s response to the 1998 murder of Matthew Shepard, a young gay man living in Laramie, Wyoming. In a series of poignant reflections, the residents of Laramie react to the hate crime and surrounding media storm with anger, bewilderment and sorrow. The play portrays the seismic and deeply personal impact Matthew’s death had on this small town while also demonstrating the power of the human spirit to triumph over bigotry and violence."
