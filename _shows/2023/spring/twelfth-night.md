description: 'After being rescued from the shipwreck that killed her twin brother, Viola finds herself stranded in Illyria, a quaint town on the East Coast of the United States. Seeking some security and independence in a conservative town in the late 1950’s, Viola decides to disguise herself as a man under the name ‘Cesario’ and work for the Mayor of Illyria: Duke Orsino. Orsino sends Viola to woo Olivia, the grieving heiress he pines for, on his behalf, but complications ensue when Olivia falls for ‘Cesario’ and Viola falls for Orsino. The townsfolk and members of Olivia’s household meddle in the lives of these characters and each other, weaving a web of confusion across Illyria. Tickets are FREE for this outdoor performance--just bring something to sit on and layers!'

  Production Staff:
  - name: Charlotte Manier
    role: Co-Director
    bio: "entered the 2022-2023 school year with a single goal: to take over the Dean’s Men. When she was cast as the Nurse in the fall’s production of *Romeo and Juliet*, she felt that nothing could get in the way of her climb to tyranny. That was until she met the equally conniving Jacob Halabe, who was cast as the Prince. Recognizing they both had the same sinister aim, the two actors quietly plotted against one another, playing a Succession-esque game of cut-throat power mongering. When Charlotte was cast as First Witch in *Macbeth in Space*, Jacob kept a close eye on her machinations as an Assistant Stage Manager. But when it came time for spring show proposals, the two nemeses realized how they could both achieve the American Dream of college Shakespeare theater: through collaboration. You are now presented with the fruits of their struggle for total Shakespeare domination. But be warned, this is not the end! Charlotte will serve as the new Treasurer of the Dean’s Men board until she graduates in 2024, and Jacob will continue to rule the Dean’s Men from the shadows for another two years."
