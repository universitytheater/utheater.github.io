  Spring 2023'
description: 'When the president of an anti-establishment UChicago club is murdered during their annual fundraiser, the other officers must solve his murder while trying to keep the event going. The Dead Fun Society uses the audience at the fundraiser as the detectives in their mystery, trying to keep the event going while trying to find whodunit. As the conspiracy becomes deeper and more ridiculous, the hypocrisy and comedy of each of the remaining officers becomes clear.'

roles:
  Cast:
  - name: Josh Winston
    role: Ben McGrady
    bio: "is a 2nd-year Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations major. This is his fourth UT show, having previously been in *The Trail to Oregon!* (Understudy - Men), *Marian, or the True Tale of Robin Hood* (Friar Tuck), and *The Laramie Project* (Actor 4). Josh's favorite detective is undoubtedly the world's most ridiculous detective, Inspector Gadget."
  - name: Joseph DePaula
    role: Mark Hellebrand
    bio: "is a first-year History major. He was last seen performing in Cup of Theater’s *The Physicists* as too many characters to count (6, to be exact). He was also Little John in UT’s *Marian, or the True Tale of Robin Hood*, and he is Il Dottore in Attori Senza Paura, the Commedia dell’Arte RSO on campus! He’d also like you to know that, while he appreciates all of them dearly, he suspects any of the cast or crew might have a hand in his eventual, gruesome murder outside of the ISAC. His favorite detective is Lieutenant Columbo, but Joseph is also a big fan of Shawn Spencer (head psychic detective for the S.B.P.D.) and his partner, Sh’Dynasty (that’s S-H comma-to-the-top Dynasty)."
  - name: Catherine Rohret
    role: Danny Knight
    bio: "is a fourth-year Religious Studies and Creative Writing double major. They have previously worked on *Marian, or the True Tale of Robin Hood* (Tommy of No Consequence).

    bio: "is a second-year Chemistry major.

As an avid lover of murder mysteries, she hopes you have a blast solving this one; though, despite her love and appreciation for her fellow cast members, production team, and everyone who tries to crack the case, she still firmly believes Miss Jane Marple, her favorite detective, would solve it first (though Nancy Drew ranks a close second!)."
