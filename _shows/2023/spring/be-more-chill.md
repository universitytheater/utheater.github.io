He’s so excited to share what has genuinely been one of his favorite shows with you all, and he would like to thank his family for supporting his love of theatre, his mentors Dani Baldwin and Blake Wales for never leading him astray, and the cast and crew of *Be More Chill*—one of the most passionate and dedicated groups of people he’s ever had the fortune of working with.
