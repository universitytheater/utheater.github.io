description: 'Jeremy Heere is just an average teenager. That is, until he finds out about "The SQUIP," a super quantum unit intel processor from Japan that promises to bring him everything he desires most, a date with Christine, an invite to the raddest party of the year, and a chance to survive life at his suburban New Jersey high school. But is being the most popular guy in school worth the risk? Based on the novel by Ned Vizzini, Be More Chill asks how we can find and become the best version of ourselves.'
