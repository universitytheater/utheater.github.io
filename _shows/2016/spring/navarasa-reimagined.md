description: "<p><em>Exploring classical emotions through pure dance.</em>\_Navarasa:\
  \ Reimagined weaves passages from the English translation of Vincente Huidobro's\
  \ epic poem Altazor with a set of unique soundtracks to depict the nine classical\
  \ emotions known as Navarasa. With eight dance vignettes, Apsara explores the relationship\
  \ between pure technique and storytelling movements that bring to life a deeply-rooted\
  \ artistic tradition for contemporary audiences.</p> <p><strong>Choreographers</strong><br/>\n\
