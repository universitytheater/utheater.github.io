description: "<p>by Michael Frayn<br/>\ndirected by Alex Hearn</p><p>Erratic actors\
  \ are unraveling under the pressure on the eve of opening night as the director\
  \ struggles to keep his production from tumbling into chaos in Michael Frayn\u2019\
  s Tony Award-winning farce. Directed by Alex Hearn, Noises off takes audiences backstage\
  \ to experience the drama unfolding out of the spotlight and in the wings. When\
  \ the curtain falls on forgotten lines and abandoned plots, romantic hopes may be\
  \ dashed and careers trashed.</p><p>\_</p><p><strong>Laurie Beckoff</strong> (Dotty\
