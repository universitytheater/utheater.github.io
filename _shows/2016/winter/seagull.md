description: "<p>by Anton Chekhov, translation by Paul Schmidt<br/>\ndirected by Gwendolyn\
  \ Wiegold</p><p>Written in 1895, The Seagull is Anton Chekhov\u2019s famous tale\
  \ of romantic woe and artistic identity. Considered to be the first of Chekhov\u2019\
  s four major plays, the story is an ensemble tale of an extended family in rural\
  \ Russia grappling with themselves and each other in their quest for success and\
  \ love. Famous for debuting as a critical failure, The Seagull today stands as one\
  \ of Russia\u2019s greatest theatrical works due to the beautiful richness of humanity\
  \ in its characters that forces the audience to ask ourselves what gives us hope.</p><p>\_\
