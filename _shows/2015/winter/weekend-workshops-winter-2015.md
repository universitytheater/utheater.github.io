  <p>A Weekend of Workshops offers a stage to directors, devisers and performers hoping to exercise and explore their craft. This Winter, directors choose moments which explore our relationship to wrongdoing. In <em>Light Touch</em>, Chris Deakin uses Shakespeare’s text and Walt’s imagery to attempt a modern vengeance. Eric Kirkes looks for intimacy in the wake of mistake in selections from <em>Rabbit Hole</em>. In selections from <em>Angels in America</em>, Natalie Wagner confronts distinct expectations of love. And Andrew Mao’s <em>I, Iago</em> imagines Othello’s story from a more villainous perspective. Work it out this winter. </p><p> </p><p class="p1">
