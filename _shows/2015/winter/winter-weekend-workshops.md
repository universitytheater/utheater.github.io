description: "<p>A Weekend of Workshops offers a stage to directors, devisers and\
  \ performers hoping to exercise and explore their craft. This Winter, directors\
  \ choose moments which explore our relationship to wrongdoing. In <em>Light Touch</em>,\
  \ Chris Deakin uses Shakespeare\u2019s text and Walt\u2019s imagery to attempt a\
  \ modern vengeance. Eric Kirkes looks for intimacy in the wake of mistake in selections\
  \ from <em>Rabbit Hole</em>. In selections from <em>Angels in America</em>, Natalie\
  \ Wagner confronts distinct expectations of love. And Andrew Mao\u2019s <em>I, Iago</em>\
  \ imagines Othello\u2019s story from a more villainous perspective. Work it out\
  \ this winter.\_</p><p>\_</p><p class=\"p1\">\nWritten by <strong>WIlliam Shakespeare</strong><br/>\n\
