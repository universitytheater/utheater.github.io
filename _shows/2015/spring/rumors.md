  <p>People are talking in Neil Simon’s Rumors, directed by Alex Hearn, and the talk is all over the place. Invited by the deputy mayor to a dinner party, four couples are greeted by the sound of gunshots. The posh soiree they expected is overwhelmed by gossip and lies as each guest tries to juggle the mystery and their meal. Intrigue gives way to absurdity, and your guess is as bad as anyone’s. </p><p>by <strong>Neil Simon</strong><br/>
