  t too far apart in Love\u2019s Labour\u2019s Lost, written by William Shakespeare\

  \ young scholars must choose between their ivory tower and the wits of four brilliant\
  \ coeds. Together they employ pranks and poetry in pursuit of love, challenging\
  \ an over-serious academy with humor and youth. As graduation looms, the students\
  \ must decide what moments they\u2019ll cherish and what follies they\u2019ll leave\
  \ behind.</span></p><p><strong>Sam Audette</strong> (Longaville) is a second-year\
