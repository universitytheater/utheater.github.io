  <strong>A devised work inspired by the eponymous text, by Charles Mee<br/>

  Directed by Alexander Eichner &amp; Sarah Kim</strong></p><p>

  House of Cards was an experimental piece of site-specific performance art, devised
  with the designers and cast and staged in the Ida Noyes Cloister Club using tents
  to create close, intimate spaces. The original text is a meandering walk through
  the memories and musings of the speaker in a surreal dreamscape, vacillating between
  sweet, tender recollections and violent images of trauma. Working closely with the
  text, we devised a series of vignettes capturing aspects of the text with sound,
  lights, movement, and voice. We presented these pieces in various different orders
  to small groups, led from tent to tent through the vast, dark, and empty Cloister
  Club.</p><p>
