description: "<p>Weekend of Workshops offers a stage to directors, devisers and performers\
  \ hoping to exercise and explore their craft. This Fall, directors choose moments\

  Lexi Turner imagines life in the wake of violent acts in <em>Women on Trial</em>.\

  \ limits of ambition. Coriander Mayer\u2019s <em>The Candles </em>examines the world\
