  \ and ruminate on what went wrong. On his 69th birthday, an aging and so far unsuccessful\
  \ writer indulges in an annual ritual of reflection in Samuel Beckett\u2019s <em>Krapp\u2019\
  s Last Tape</em>, directed by Jonathan Sorce. But in confronting his former selves,\
  \ he must also confront his past full of missed opportunities for happiness, traded\
  \ for the sake of his work. When the best days of life have already passed and the\
  \ sum of all those years is nothing more than regret, from bananas to red wine\u2014\
  \ it all tastes like loneliness.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-794e55af-8624-a9c4-6b5e-b187193df078\"\
