description: 
  - "Prospero, a once renowned noble and artist, and his daughter Miranda are stranded on a deserted island, accompanied only by Prospero’s magical powers and magical servants Ariel and Caliban. To enact revenge against his traitorous brother Antonio, Prospero shipwrecks a boat full of nobles onto his island. In the storm the young Prince Ferdinand is separated from the group, in his haze he stumbles upon Miranda, and the two fall in love (much to the chagrin of Prospero). Meanwhile Caliban pressures the nobles’ servants Stephano and Trinculo to kill Prospero and take over the island. As all of this happens Prospero tries in vain to keep control over his domain. Magic abounds, time slips and falls, and ultimately no one is completely sure what is real."

Honor is so grateful to have had such a wonderful four years with the Dean’s Men; it may be true that “parting is such sweet sorrow,” but just as true as Shakespeare’s own words is that “once a Dean’s Man, always a Dean’s Man.” Honor’s favorite jazz album is Ella Fitzgerald’s Swingin’ Christmas!"

Regardless though, he’s very excited for this, his last show ever, and for the opportunity to do theater for the last time with his very good friends Josiah and Lucy, whom he loves very much. They’ve given him the chance to embrace his truest self onstage and he couldn’t be happier (his truest self being an alcoholic menace who causes problems and then tries to flirt his way out of them of course).
