description: "What does it mean to \"capture life\" in a single frame? Are we defined by the moments \"in focus\" or the ones in between? 35mm: A Musical Exhibition challenges audiences to sink their teeth into a musical that doesn't offer answers, only moments, stopped in time. In a thrilling collaboration between music, dance, and design, 35mm features an eclectic selection of songs created alongside a series of photographs; exploring themes of life, love, and loss and asking us a deceptively simple question: What is it all for?"
