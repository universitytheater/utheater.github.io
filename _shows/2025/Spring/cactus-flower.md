description:
  - "An aging nurse. Her playboy boss, who she’s in love with. His uncomfortably-younger girlfriend, who thinks he’s married with kids. And her playwright neighbor, who saved her life."
  - "Dr. Julian Winston has a lot of relationships to juggle: Work wives, fake wives, really-wanna-be wives. And he’s not equipped to handle half of one of those relationships. When his girlfriend, Toni, tries to kill herself because their relationship isn’t going anywhere, he proposes to her. But she thinks he’s married—because that’s what he told her. When he says he’s getting a divorce, she insists on meeting his wife (so she won’t be a ‘home-breaker’), and he must enlist his lovelorn, all-business assistant, Stephanie. But, of course, Toni can tell that Stephanie’s in love. And from here, the lie snowballs…"
  - "This screwball comedy, adapted from a French play by Barillet & Grédy, has been described as “funny,” and as having “flower power.” Don’t believe us, or don’t know what that means? Come find out for yourself, either way!"

roles:
  Cast:
    - role: Julian
      name: Gabriel Brumberg
      bio: "is a third-year Fundamentals and TAPS double major. Previous academic credits include: TAPS Department: The Ballad of Oedipus (Oedipus); UChicago Dean's Men: Twelfth Night (Feste); Edmund Burke School: Urinetown (Bobby). Other credits include: Shakespeare Theatre Company: Noura (Yazen); Pallas Theater Collective: Assassins (Billy); Variations Theater Company: Capriccio Radio (Noah); Fire Escape Films: The Scottish Play (Leo); and several workshopped readings of new plays. His fake family members are famous cheese-makers in the French countryside who excommunicated him for inadvertently sharing secret recipes with a rival family..."
    - role: Stephanie
      name: Caroline Lopez
      bio: "is a fourth year chemistry major who might be frantically editing her thesis backstage at this very moment. In her time with UT, she has acted in 13th Morning (Viola), Much Ado About Nothing (Borachio), Dead Fun Society (Aspen), Queen of Spades (Bishop), Marian (Guard), and The Trail to Oregon (u/s Mother) and directed The Play that Goes Wrong. She met her very best friends through theater, people who have laughed with her, cried with her, kept her sane after 13 hours in a reg room, driven her a little closer to insanity, and generally made her a better human. She is incredibly grateful to all of them and most especially to everyone who has made this production such a joy. She would love to introduce you to her fake wife, really, she's a lovely woman, but, uh, she's from Canada, they met on a road trip, and all of their photos together were destroyed in a freak Frog Incident. So you can see why she's not fielding any inquiries at this time."
    - role: Toni Simmons
      name: Ilie Sturhan
      bio: "began acting as a child in Texas, appearing in her first feature length film, Shilo, at the age of ten. At UChicago she has previously appeared in Arcadia (Valentine Coverly). She currently is pursuing both her acting career and her undergraduate degree in Chemistry. Big thanks to her family, friends, and the cast and crew of Cactus Flower for making this production an incredible experience. If she had a fake family, they would be the family from Schitt's Creek because they're always very present in their own lives. "
    - role: Igor
      name: Griffin Bonnin Jones
      bio: "is pleased as hell to be playing Igor in this show. They have previously appeared in Dean's Men's productions of Romeo and Juliet (2022), Twelfth Night (2023), Richard III (2024), and A Midsummer Night's Dream (2024). They were also an assistant stage manager on Muscle Memory (2023) and they directed The Arsonists this past fall quarter, but this is their first non-Shakespeare UT acting role. Their fake family is just horrible. One of the worst fake families out there, just absolutely abysmal."
    - role: Harvey
      name: Simon Tsuchiya Lenoe
      bio: "is a first-year PhD student in East Asian Languages and Civilizations, playing the lecherous actor, Harvey. His fake family includes FKA Twigs (sister), Chicago Cubs shortstop Dansby Swanson (second cousin) and Spencer O’Brien (formerly vassaled to). "
    - role: Señor Arturo Sánchez
      name: Spencer O'Brien
      bio: "is a highly lauded acting swiss army knife. Not only can he do three consecutive standing back flips, but having performed in two UT productions thus far, he is excited to be following his role of Jason in Strings Attached and Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing with his crowning acting achievement, Señor Arturo Sánchez. Now, add him on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/spencer-ob) to help him get to 500 connections."
    - role: Mrs. Dixon Durant
      name: Ellie Levy
      bio: "is a first year TAPS and Political Science Double Major. With UT she has previously been in Royal Flush (Aurelia) and Theater[24] (Crystal). Her fake husband is a prince but without all the family baggage."
    - role: Botticelli's Springtime
      name: Eleni Lefakis
      bio: "is a fourth-year TAPS and RLLT double-major and former UT Treasurer. Her UT mainstage credits are The Heirs (Stage Manager); The Trail to Oregon!

She is also currently assistant directing Court Theatre’s world premiere production of Mickle Maher’s Berlin and hopes that you go see a performance of that (when you’re not seeing Cactus Flower, of course). Eleni cannot overstate how delighted she is to have THE Joseph DePaula directing the only UT show she’s ever acted in and her fake husband is the closeted gay heir to a Greek shipping empire. Their lavender marriage has produced two beautiful children, a boy and a girl, via surrogacy, and their prenup states that in the event of a divorce she gets the kids, the mansion in Ekali, the megayacht, the Paros island beach house, and the membership to the Tatoi Club."
