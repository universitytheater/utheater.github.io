description:
  - "An aging nurse. Her playboy boss, who she’s in love with. His uncomfortably-younger girlfriend, who thinks he’s married with kids. And her playwright neighbor, who saved her life."
  - "Dr. Julian Winston has a lot of relationships to juggle: Work wives, fake wives, really-wanna-be wives. And he’s not equipped to handle half of one of those relationships. When his girlfriend, Toni, tries to kill herself because their relationship isn’t going anywhere, he proposes to her. But she thinks he’s married—because that’s what he told her. When he says he’s getting a divorce, she insists on meeting his wife (so she won’t be a ‘home-breaker’), and he must enlist his lovelorn, all-business assistant, Stephanie. But, of course, Toni can tell that Stephanie’s in love. And from here, the lie snowballs…"
  - "This screwball comedy, adapted from a French play by Barillet & Grédy, has been described as “funny,” and as having “flower power.” Don’t believe us, or don’t know what that means? Come find out for yourself, either way!"
