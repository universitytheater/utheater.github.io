description: 90s, grunge, and denim on denim; welcome to the Trojan War. These crazy kids are trying to figure out what to do with their lives when the Troubles they’ve grown up with start becoming all too real. Troilus and Cressida are trying to fall in love while their world is falling apart; the play takes classic characters like Achilles and Ulysses and turns them upside down, sidekicks in someone else’s story mostly used for (hilarious) sex jokes, and (epic) fight scenes. Come see one of Shakespeare’s least-performed plays, in an angsty new take, set entirely inside one Belfast pub and featuring the music of the Cranberries.
