description: Think of all of the things you’d have done, if only you’d known. If/Then is a contemporary musical that explores the complexities of choice and chance through the life of Elizabeth, a city planner who returns to New York in search of a fresh start. As she navigates the city's possibilities of love, career, and self-discovery, a single decision splits her life into two parallel paths; Liz and Beth. If/Then follows both stories simultaneously as this modern woman faces the question; What If? <br> <br> Special Thanks to Adrian Lo
