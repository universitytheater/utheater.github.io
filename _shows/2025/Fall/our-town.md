subheader: 
author: Thornton Wilder
description: 
  - A breakfast before school, first loves, and those quiet ordinary miracles that fill our days. Welcome to Grover’s Corners, NH, in the year 1901. Everyone knows each others' business, and the milkman still makes house calls. 
  - Thornton Wilder’s “Our Town” might look like your average slice of small-town life, but the people of Grover’s Corners remind us how life’s biggest moments often hide in the smallest details.
