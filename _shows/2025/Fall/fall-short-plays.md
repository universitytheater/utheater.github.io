- title: We're Live
  author: Nate LePelley
  description: "We're Live follows a college boy, Ky, who is looking to make it big as a streamer in the ever-changing environment of content creators. As he changes his plans and ideas to grow an ever-increasing following, what does he have to sacrifice in order to make his dream a reality? Will he have to alter who he is? Only time will tell how much needs to be lost so that he gains what heâ€™s wanted."
