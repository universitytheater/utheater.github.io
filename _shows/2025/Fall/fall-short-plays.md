  - Join us for this quarter's Short Play Showcase! Every fall and winter quarter, we produce one or more short plays, often student-written. These shows are a great opportunity to get involved at a lower level of commitment. If you're interested in being a part of a future short play, subscribe to the <a href="/listhosts">UT General Listhost</a>.

- title: We're Live
  author: Nate LePelley
  description: "We're Live follows a college boy, Ky, who is looking to make it big as a streamer in the ever-changing environment of content creators. As he changes his plans and ideas to grow an ever-increasing following, what does he have to sacrifice in order to make his dream a reality? Will he have to alter who he is? Only time will tell how much needs to be lost so that he gains what heâ€™s wanted."
