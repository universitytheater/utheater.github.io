description: "<p>Shakespeare's masterpiece struggles to survive amidst the mounting\
  \ rubble of literary and political history. Failed ideals and human disillusionment\
  \ give way in Hamletmachine to the youth clamoring in reaction against the past\
  \ in order to change the present. To break free of the continual cycle of violence\
  \ within history the past is questioned and deconstructed. Moving away from psychological\
  \ narrative, Hamletmachine creates a landscape of the betrayed revolution. This\
  \ performance is an exploration into the place of theatre as a sight of revolutionary\
  \ change. In M\xFCller's words, \"the slogan of the Napoleonic era still applies:\
  \ Theater is the Revolution on the march.\"</p><p>Appropriate for ages 18 and up.\
