description: '<p><span>It''s Thanksgiving, and Marty''s arrival home is greatly anticipated
  by his mother, Mrs. Pascal, his twin sister, Jackie-O, and his younger brother,
  Anthony. He arrives during a hurricane, but worse than the storm is the fact that
  Marty brings Lesly, his fiancée. This ruins everything. Marty''s engagement is a
  threat to the well-being of this family and a greater threat to Jackie-O, who has
  always wanted her brother for herself. On top of that, Jackie-O has just recently
  been released from a mental hospital, Anthony dropped out of Princeton, and their
  mother has a serious problem handling any of this. This is also a family severely
  affected by the Kennedy family, whose Virginia Compound makes them neighbors with
  the Pascals.</span></p><p><span>by </span><strong>Wendy Macleod </strong><br/><span>co-directed
