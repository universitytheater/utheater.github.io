description: "<p><span>It's Thanksgiving, and Marty's arrival home is greatly anticipated\
  \ by his mother, Mrs. Pascal, his twin sister, Jackie-O, and his younger brother,\
  \ Anthony. He arrives during a hurricane, but worse than the storm is the fact that\
  \ Marty brings Lesly, his fianc\xE9e. This ruins everything. Marty's engagement\
  \ is a threat to the well-being of this family and a greater threat to Jackie-O,\
  \ who has always wanted her brother for herself. On top of that, Jackie-O has just\
  \ recently been released from a mental hospital, Anthony dropped out of Princeton,\
  \ and their mother has a serious problem handling any of this. This is also a family\
  \ severely affected by the Kennedy family, whose Virginia Compound makes them neighbors\
  \ with the Pascals.</span></p><p><span>by\_</span><strong>Wendy Macleod\_</strong><br/><span>co-directed\
