description: "<p>At the center of the play is one of the greatest roles in modern\
  \ drama, the fascinating Hedda Gabler, who finds herself stranded in a seemingly\
  \ ordinary but dangerously imbalanced domestic system. It includes her husband,\
  \ the ambitious scholar George Tesman, his doting Aunt Julie and the powerful Judge\
  \ Brack, who seems intent on playing a very large role in the young couple's life.\
  \ Into this mix comes an old schoolmate of Hedda's, Thea Elvsted, who has courageously\
  \ abandoned a loveless marriage in favor of the passionate partnership she has found\
  \ with the troubled Eilert Lovborg, a brilliant thinker who is an academic rival\
  \ of Tesman's and who shares an intense secret history with Hedda. Employing methods\
  \ that virtually defined the modern psychological drama, Ibsen stealthily reveals\
  \ the bitter conflicts and thwarted longings that lie just below the \"civilized\"\
  \ transactions of daily life.</p><p>by\_<strong>Henrik\_Ibsen</strong><br/>\n\t\
