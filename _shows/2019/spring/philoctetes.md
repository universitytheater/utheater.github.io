description: "<p>Ten years have passed since Philoctetes, wielder of the bow of Heracles,\
  \ was abandoned on an island as punishment. Now, in the midst of the Trojan war,\
  \ Odysseus learns Philoctetes\u2019 magical bow is the only hope in saving the Greeks\
  \ and winning the war. In a quest for the bow, Sophocles\u2019 epic tragedy asks\
  \ if we are willing to sacrifice our morality for our country, and at what cost?\_\
