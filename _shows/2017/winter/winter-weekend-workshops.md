  ><span>Every quarter, </span><span>A Weekend of Workshops</span><span> allows directors\
  \ to devise and stage big ideas on a small scale. This Winter\u2019s workshops take\
  \ well trodden tales and explore them from a new angle. </span><span><em>Pericles,\
  \ but Marxist</em>,</span><span> directed by Coriander Mayer gives voice to the\
  \ unnamed proletariat of Shakespeare\u2019s late epic. </span><em><span>Selections\
  \ from The Cherry Orchard</span></em><span>, directed by Rami Kablawi, explores\
  \ the same scenes as comedy and tragedy. And </span><em><span>A World of His Own:\_\
  a Twilight Zone Parody</span></em><span>, directed by Emma Heras, asks how does\
  \ one deceive, or at least, surprise, a live audience.</span></span></p><p><strong><em>Pericles,\
