  written by William Shakespeare
  directed by Laura Bevington
description: '<p><span>It''s the War of the Roses unlike ever before: within the confines
  of a classroom, schoolyard rules and storied rulers will be tested. Witness history
  conjured up—a chalkboard sketches the royal lineage and counts the dead, yardsticks
  stand for swords, paper airplanes and ink for arrows and blood, as the noble Houses
  of York and Lancaster renew their bitter struggle for the Crown of England. The
  text of Shakespeare will temper students and kings as they wonder: will chaos or
  convention reign at battle''s end?</span></p> <p><strong>Bella Bagatelos</strong>
