description: '<p>How do we respond to crisis? Does that change depending on who’s
  watching? Winner of three 2009 Tony Awards and the 2010 Pulitzer Prize, Next to
  Normal investigates the effects of mental illness and trauma on a family that’s
  desperately trying to keep it together. Accompanied by an energy-filled score, this
  pop-rock musical by Tom Kitt and Brian Yorkey questions the ethics of modern psychiatry
  and what it means to be “normal.”</p><p><strong><em>CAST</em></strong></p><p><span
