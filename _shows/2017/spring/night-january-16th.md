  ><span>On January 16th, 1934, near midnight, the body of a man came hurtling down\
  \ and crashed at the foot of the Faulkner Building in Manhattan. What happened on\
  \ that fateful night that led to a business tycoon's tragic death? In this murder\
  \ mystery, you will attend a court hearing in 1930's, ponder contradicting testimonies,\
  \ and join us in a jury that delivers the verdict of a century. 80 years after the\
  \ play's Broadway debut, Windmill Drama revitalizes this Ayn Rand play's original\
  \ splendor in Mandarin Chinese, offering the audience a theatre experience like\
  \ no other. </span><em><span>The performance is in Mandarin Chinese with detailed\
  \ English synopsis provided. Everyone is welcome. \_</span></em></span></p>"
