  <span id="docs-internal-guid-f21c4645-08b9-5e08-1ffd-4f50cf4f4934"><span>On January 16th, 1934, near midnight, the body of a man came hurtling down and crashed at the foot of the Faulkner Building in Manhattan. What happened on that fateful night that led to a business tycoon's tragic death? In this murder mystery, you will attend a court hearing in 1930's, ponder contradicting testimonies, and join us in a jury that delivers the verdict of a century. 80 years after the play's Broadway debut, Windmill Drama revitalizes this Ayn Rand play's original splendor in Mandarin Chinese, offering the audience a theatre experience like no other. </span><em><span>The performance is in Mandarin Chinese with detailed English synopsis provided. Everyone is welcome.  </span></em></span></p>
