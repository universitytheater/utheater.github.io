  ><span>New Work Week presents a festival of premieres: come see this series of original\
  \ play readings, staged adaptations, and the final products of TAPS Bachelor\u2019\

  \ theatrical training in the College. \_All of it is \_student-written, all of it\
  \ is student-directed. You could attend just one show--or you could purchase a $12\
  \ Festival Pass that will get you into all twelve works for just $1 per show. \_\
  See you there.</span></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong><em>Making A Killing\_\
  </em></strong>by Val Bodurtha, dir. Natalie Pasquinelli:\_You don\u2019t see serial\
  \ killers in the news anymore. It\u2019s not how it was in the 80s, the killer news\
  \ coverage replaced by television. Nobody can name a prolific serial killer, but\
  \ anyone can list their favorite serial killer shows at request. Making A Killing\
  \ is a one act comedy that asks, \u201CHow do the serial killers feel about that?\u201D\
  </p><p dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong><em>Shades\_</em></strong>by Cynthia Campos Constanzo,\
  \ dir. Megan Philippi:\_A comedic drama looking at what makes a family, and the\
  \ disparity between those properly and improperly diagnosed and treated for mental\
  \ health. In working together on a detective case, our protagonists shed light on\
  \ the treatment of minorities and highlight the power family can offer to loved\
  \ ones.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong><em>The Doll\_</em></strong>by Hayley Gruenspan,\
  \ dir. Tempest Wisdom:\_A girl brings home her trans girlfriend to her supposedly\
  \ liberal family. The situation quickly goes awry.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong><em>Carson\_\
  </em></strong>by River MacLeod, dir. Hanna Kime:\_Three friends struggle with transphobia\
  \ and suicide and to reclaim the meaning of family.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">\n<strong><em>The\
  \ Last Bus\_</em></strong>by Ellen Wiese, dir. Sophie Downes:\_Three former coworkers\
  \ and a stranger wait for the last bus at the end of the world. With the rest of\
  \ everything hidden in a never-ending rain, they discuss call centers, confessions,\
  \ and a carnivorous newcomer. A bus arrives, an ark is built, and the waters cover\
  \ the earth.</p>"
