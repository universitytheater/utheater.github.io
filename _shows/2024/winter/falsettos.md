roles:
  Cast:
  - role: Marvin
    name: Elias Buttress
    bio: "is a first-year at The College. This is his second UT credit after being an assistant production manager for Muscle Memory. When not onstage or in class, he enjoys listening to jazz. He would like to thank his parents for their support and UT for this opportunity."
  - role: Whizzer
    name: Steele Citrone
    bio: "is a 4th year BA/MA student majoring in MAAD(Games) and Mastering in Digital Studies. He has previously only acted and directed with Deans Men's productions, so he is excited to finally work and preform in a spacious Logan Center Theater (no more basement rehearsals)! In his free time, when he's not doing homework and making fun of his friends old high school bios, Steele, like Whizzer, likes to play games! While Canasta is not on his daily rotation, he does truly get embarrassingly upset over Chess. Steele hopes you enjoy this performance of the greatest musical ever conceived, well that may be a tad hyperbolic, but he doesn't have time to argue semantics; the show is about to begin!"
