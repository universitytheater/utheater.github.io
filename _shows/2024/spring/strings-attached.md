On top of his recent acting credits—'The Taming of the Shrew' (Dean's Men); 'Dead Fun Society' (UT); 'The Physicists' (CoT); and 'Marian, or the True Tale of Robin Hood' (UT)—he is also Events Manager for Cup of Theater, Production Manager/Co-Outreach Coordinator for Attori Senza Paura (the Commedia dell'Arte troupe on campus) and Co-Outreach Chair for University Theater Committee. His 'man in the mirror' is Paul Giamatti, for reasons both myriad and cryptic."

He has previously directed two shorts for Fire Escape Films, 'Remember Paul?'(2023) and 'Eunomia' (2022), as well as acting in... eh... a bunch of other stuff. If he was a puppet looking in a mirror who was to have a human counterpart staring back at him, his human would ideally be the Mars Cheese Castle."

She genuinely can’t thank everyone enough for putting up with the unadulterated chaos that this process has been, and yet she has to double that thanks to Althea, Adrian, and Jeff, who have been working on this for far too long. The human to Eleni’s puppet is factually contractually Danielle Yablonovskiy (they even look alike)."

She is endlessly grateful to the band for their passion and support, as well as Adrian for being her partner in crime throughout the entire process; it's a real dream come true conducting and playing with them.

Outside of this company, she would like to thank her roommates and best friends, Charitha and Doreen for dealing with her chaotic schedule and her mom for coming all this way for another show.
