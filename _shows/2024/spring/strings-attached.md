description: 'It’s 2012. Walt, a puppet of a man, just turned thirty-three. Jason and Amy’s tenth anniversary is tomorrow. And Dallas Richman‘s debts have come to collect. Strings Attached is the tale of one puppet’s journey of self discovery, two lovers’ engagement, and one oil baron’s path to redemption. Good times and laughs are sure to be had by all.'
