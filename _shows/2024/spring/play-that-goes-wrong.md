title: Play That Goes Wrong
slug: play-that-goes-wrong
subheader: "Written by Henry Lewis, Jonathan Sayer, and Henry Shields

  Directed by Caroline Lopez

  Spring 2024"
description: "The Play that Goes Wrong is a play-within-a-play comedy about a well-meaning, but inept theater group attempting to put on the fictitious Murder at Haversham Manor. While the play has been rehearsed, the props and set are gorgeous and mostly functional, and the actors look wonderful, a mix of Murphy's Law, dropped lines, and pride result in a series of errors, culminating with the very stage falling apart around them. The Play that Goes Wrong is a testament to the love of theater and gives us perfectionists a chance to step back and laugh at ourselves."

roles:
  Cast:
  - role: Chris
    name: Joshua Winston
    bio: "is a third-year Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations Major. His previous UT shows include Trail to Oregon (Understudy - Men), Marian, or the True Tale of Robin Hood (Friar Tuck), The Laramie Project (Actor 4/Moises Kaufman), and Dead Fun Society (Ben). He is incredibly excited to be a part of this show and grateful to everyone involved in this process for making this show possible. His goes wrong moment is when he was forced to replace someone a full foot shorter than him halfway through a performance of High School Musical."
  - role: Robert
    name: Fernando Paiz
    bio: "is a first year prospective molecular engineering major. The Play That Goes Wrong is his University Theater debut! Some of his favorite roles from the past include: King Basilius in Head Over Heels, Richard Hannay in The 39 Steps, and Bill in Lobby Hero, all of which were under the Performing Arts department of Milton Academy. His 'goes wrong' moment stems all the way back to his sixth grade production of Wonka, in which, on opening night, the chocolate river prop, a long flowing brown silk, went missing. In a stalwart attempt to play off this miscue, Fernando tried to convince the rest of the oompa-loompas to 'become the river.' They did not, and alas, he was the lone loompa waving his arms in front of the stage."
  - role: Dennis
    name: Michael Guiliano
    bio: "is a first year with varied interests including Physics, East Asian Languages and Civilization, and Glee. Previous roles include Bill Austin from Mamma Mia! and Demetrius in a Midsummer Night's Dream. His 'goes wrong' moment is when he had to physically replace a fellow performer‘s wig in an middle school production of Bye Bye Birdie after it became airborne mid-scene."
  - role: Sandra
    name: Liv Moreno
    bio: "is a second year majoring in Global Studies and minoring in Health and Society. This is her first play at UChicago, but some of her favorite previous roles have been in Three Sisters (Natasha), Singin’ in the Rain (Dora Bailey), and Our Town (Emily u/s). She is so grateful to have worked on such a fun show with such a supportive group of people, and wants to thank Caroline for being a kind and patient director. Her personal best 'goes wrong' moment in theater was when she was an ASM for a show, and when she walked through the curtains to put a prop on stage, the curtain rod fell from the ceiling onto her head and concussed her! She hopes nothing like that will happen in this performance, and hopes you enjoy the show!"
  - role: Max
    name: Collin Polasky
    bio: "is a third-year Computer Science and Economics major. He's previously been a part of Queen of Spades (Hermann) and is super excited to be back on stage for his first full production at UChicago. He's had a blast putting this show together with this incredible cast and crew. Special shoutouts to Rory, Eleni, and Jon who encouraged him to actually audition despite his trademark indecisiveness. His goes wrong moment was in 8th grade when he not only missed going on stage but when he did appear he was wearing half of two separate costumes."
  - role: Annie
    name: Kati Langille
    bio: "debuted with University Theater in this main stage production. Her real-life 'goes wrong' moment was when she was a cow in a grade school show and coughed in the middle of her moo-sical number. Thankfully the cow’s sickness was canonical, and people thought the performance was spot on. Kati, however, sobbed."
  - role: Taylor
    name: Lucienne Totti
    bio: "is a second-year Political Science and TAPS major. She has previously worked on UT shows, Perfect Match (Jessie), and Strings Attached (Assistant Vocal Director). Before college that she was trained in Opera and Musical Theater for most of her adolescence. She was born and raised in Puerto Rico, and misses the island everyday. Outside of UT she likes to go on adventures downtown and greet every dog that approaches her. You can usually find her studying in the Logan Center, or occasionally in the basement of Phi Delt. My best 'goes wrong' moment in theater was when I played a nun in 'Sound of Music' for a high school performance. The set of in this case 'the chapel' ended up falling behind us as we sang the scene the last night of the show. No one was hurt but it became a hazard the rest of the show."
  - role: Johnathan
    name: Sean Moore
    bio: "is a third year Economics, Math and Philosophy major. This is his first full production with UT, but he has previously written and performed in Theater[24]. His 'goes wrong' moment was the crew accidentally blacking out the lights in the middle of a performance of Newsies. He would like to thank the cast and crew for all the hard work they've put into the show."
  Production Staff:
  - role: Director
    name: Caroline Lopez
    bio: "is a third year Chemistry major and, more importantly, incredibly grateful for all the hard work everyone in this company has put into turning the chaos in her brain into a full-fledged production. Like Chris, she is also making her directorial debut, though you may have seen her on stage in Dead Fun Society, Marian, Queen of Spades, or The Trail to Oregon! She would like to thank every single person who supported this production for making it a reality. There are over 30 people in this company: they are all incredible human beings and wonderfully, wonderfully talented artists who are capable of minor miracles. While she is certain The Murder at Haversham Manor will not go wrong (knock on wood), it has forced her to relive her own worst 'goes wrong' moment in which she snapped a prop knife on the stomach of Tony in West Side Story while stabbing him: he’s fine, they’re still really good friends, she swears, no need to check up on him!"

In his free time, he enjoys coding and fighting the university bureaucracy. andreithuler.com"
  - role: Stage Manager
    name: Jinhee Kim
    bio: "is a MAPH alum in EALC and TAPs. She has previously worked on Muscle Memory (Assistant Stage Manager). She had many 'goes wrong moments' in her past productions, but one of the most notable ones happened during her first show ever in undergrad. She was the light board operator. An actor had one job: to walk across the stage at the end of the scene. For whatever reason, he decided to walk across the stage at the beginning of the scene. Other actors had to immediately jump to the end of the scene. She had to rapidly go through a couple of light changes (luckily there was no sound cues in this scene). More importantly, she had helped write a part of this scene and was very sad none of it got delivered. This was also the first time she heard her director (who was watching from the booths) swear. A year later for a different show, she also had the wonderful experience of programming light cues as SM/light designer while the house was open, finishing two minutes before show time (swearing in Korean the whole time. Her ASM/board operators were incredibly amused). She is very grateful to everyone in this wonderful production! (especially that she did not have to go near light or sound board)"
