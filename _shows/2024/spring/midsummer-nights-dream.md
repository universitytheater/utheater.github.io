  Directed by Jo Selmeczy

  Spring 2024"
description: "Hermia, Helena, Lysander, and Demetrius are in a classic Shakespearean love triangle: Hermia's father, Egeus, won't let her marry Lysander, who she is in love with, and instead tells her to marry Demetrius, who Helena is in love with. To escape this restriction, Hermia and Lysander run away into the forest, pursued by Demetrius who is pursued by Helena, where their relationships are interfered with by a band of trouble-making fairies. Simultaneously, a band of industry workers called The Mechanicals are rehearsing a play in the forest when their leader, Bottom, gets his head transformed into a donkey by a fairy named Puck. Love potions and anti-love potions run amuck, amping up the chaos tenfold. Finally, all is set right by Puck, and the two couples (Lysander and Hermia, Helena and Demetrius) get married and they all watch The Mechanicals' play."
