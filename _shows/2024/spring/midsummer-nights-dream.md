title: A Midsummer Night's Dream
slug: midsummer-nights-dream
subheader: "By William Shakespeare

  Directed by Jo Selmeczy

  Spring 2024"
description: "Hermia, Helena, Lysander, and Demetrius are in a classic Shakespearean love triangle: Hermia's father, Egeus, won't let her marry Lysander, who she is in love with, and instead tells her to marry Demetrius, who Helena is in love with. To escape this restriction, Hermia and Lysander run away into the forest, pursued by Demetrius who is pursued by Helena, where their relationships are interfered with by a band of trouble-making fairies. Simultaneously, a band of industry workers called The Mechanicals are rehearsing a play in the forest when their leader, Bottom, gets his head transformed into a donkey by a fairy named Puck. Love potions and anti-love potions run amuck, amping up the chaos tenfold. Finally, all is set right by Puck, and the two couples (Lysander and Hermia, Helena and Demetrius) get married and they all watch The Mechanicals' play."

  - role: Tom Snout/Cobweb 
    name: Nora Schultz

She has also served on the Dean’s Men Board for three years, the last two as Secretary, and she trusts that her beloved board will be in good hands! As a known fan of the history plays and frequent enjoyer of performing masculinity (see the roles above, her BA thesis, and also her recent tenure as Henry VII in Pope LARP class), her drag king name will have to be John False Staff. All the love possible to University Theater, Dean’s Men, family, friends, and Honor (who this cast and crew repeatedly mixed her up with, which she takes as high flattery)."
  - role: Snug/Mustardseed 
    name: Juan’Shalyn Ward
  - role: Robin Starveling/Peaseblossom 
    name: Honor Torrance
    bio: "is a fourth-year studying English & Cinema and Media, and the current Arts Chair for the Dean's Men. If you've been following the HTDMBCU (Honor Torrance Dean's Men Bio Cinematic Universe) of this year, it may be exciting for you to know that she is now free of that accurséd thesis! As a result, she is now frequently found standing listlessly in random locations, staring blankly at the wall and muttering Chicago-style citations of Victorian literature. Honor was last seen offstage co-directing Richard III with fellow Fairy/Mechanical Nora; she was last seen onstage causing problems on purpose as the conniving servant to a lovestruck aristocrat (Tranio, The Taming of the Shrew) and causing problems on purpose as the conniving servant to a lovestruck aristocrat (Maria, Twelfth Night). But all that conniving was real hard on the brain, so she is relieved to be taking a much-needed break in the form of Peaseblossom, who doesn't waste time with silly things like thinking, and Robin Starveling, who has never had a single thought in his life. If Honor had a drag name, it would be Penny Dreadful."
