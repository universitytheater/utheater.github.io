subheader: "By Max Frisch

    Directed by Griffin Bonnin Jones

    Fall 2024"
description: Gordon Biedermann has it all. A beautiful home, a thriving hair tonic business, a loving wife, and two arsonists holed up in his attic with several barrels of gasoline.<br><br> Max Frisch’s The Arsonists – described by its author as ‘a morality play without a moral’– is an incisive, bleakly funny commentary on the fatal impulse to acquiesce in the face of evil. Written in the aftermath of the 1948 coup in Czechoslovakia, the play is an enduring allegory about the accommodation of insidious social and political forces whose ascendance promises destruction for their enablers. In the modern America in which this staging takes place, the questions it explores – Why do individuals and societies choose conciliation over survival? When is it too late to reject the lure of those who seek our downfall? – are as relevant as ever, and their answers just as elusive.
