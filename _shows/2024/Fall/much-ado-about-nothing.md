title: Much Ado About Nothing
slug: much-ado-about-nothing
subheader: "By William Shakespeare

    Directed by Eleni Lefakis

    Fall 2024"
description: It's 2008, and a group of football's golden boys have come to Messina after the EUROs to visit friends, party, and find love. What starts as a celebratory visit quickly takes a turn as schemes collide and go too far, reputations are stained, and the status quo is disturbed. Much Ado About Nothing explores how relationships change when traditional societal expectations are challenged and morals are questioned—all while featuring one of the greatest enemies-to-lovers storylines ever written, a Shakespearean heroine who fakes her death and actually survives it, an indoor clothesline, and a bumping 2000s Europop soundtrack. <br> <br> "Don’t Sigh" was written by Althea Li and Cory Turnbaugh, with lyrics by Jefferson Lind.

roles:
    Cast:
    - name: Honor Torrance
      role: Beatrice
      bio: is thrilled to be back for an extra year with the Dean’s Men as a Master’s student in English, having recently graduated from an three-year undergrad term on the board as Arts Chair! Honor was last seen onstage running around delivering letters for lovestruck aristocrats (Peter Simple, The Merry Wives of Windsor), running around causing problems for lovestruck aristocrats (Peaseblossom/Robin Starveling, A Midsummer Night’s Dream), running around committing identity theft for a lovestruck aristocrat (Tranio, Taming of the Shrew), and running around pulling pranks for a lovestruck aristocrat (Maria, Twelfth Night). Honor’s most European traits are her love of coffee and pasta...and her very Puritan name.
    - name: Spencer O'Brien
      role: Benedick 
      bio: is a fourth-year Media Arts and Design major and British dual citizen who is elated to be joining you all for his first Deans Men Show! His sole UT mainstage credit is in the 2024 spring production of Strings Attached (Jason), and he would like to extend his utmost thanks to Eleni Lefakis and Joseph DePaula for their infinite patience and good humor. The most European thing about him is that his full name is Spencer Adonis Penelope Odysseus Homer O'Brien. And please, everyone remember, "'tis not so, nor 'twas not so; but indeed, God forbid it should be so!"
    - name: Izadora Kashper
      role: Hero

      role: Don Pedro 
      bio: "is a first-year PhD in East Asian Languages and Civilizations. He previously performed in Richard III (Buckingham) and is currently serving as the Education Chair of the Dean's Men.

      role: Don John 
      bio: "is a third-year Public Policy major. As a UT member, she's previously worked on Richard III (Prince Edward Lancaster/Marquess of Dorset) and Theatre 24 (Director). Margaret's most European trait is her penchant for taking naps in the middle of the day."

      role: Conrade 
    - name: Clee
      role: Dogberry 
      bio: "does not like writing about herself in the third person. I am incredibly grateful to everyone who shared their creative visions and collaborated on this show to bring it to life. Thank you for coming. I hope you enjoy it. "

    - name: Benjamin Tytell 
      role: Seacoal/Messenger

    Production Staff:
    - name: Eleni Lefakis
      role: Director & Co-Dramaturg
      bio: is a fourth-year TAPS and RLLT double-major currently serving as UT Treasurer. Her UT mainstage credits are The Heirs (Stage Manager); The Trail to Oregon! (Assistant Director/Dramaturg); Romeo and Juliet (Co-Production Manager); Marian, or the True Tale of Robin Hood (Assistant Director/Dramaturg); MacBeth in Space (Dramaturg); The Laramie Project (SM Collective™); Be More Chill (Co-Director); Twelfth Night (Pre-Production Manager); The Taming of The Shrew (Stage Manager/Assistant Dramaturg); Falsettos (Dramaturg); Richard III (Assistant Costume Designer); Strings Attached (Co-Director); The Play That Goes Wrong (Committee Liaison/Stagehand); and A Midsummer Night’s Dream (Dramaturg). Outside of UChicago, Eleni has also worked on shows with Teatro del Presagio, Lykofos Productions, Berlin Opera Academy, and Reptilian Affiliates Theater Co. This spring she will be Assistant Directing Berlin at Court Theatre. A high school production of Much Ado About Nothing was the first thing that made Eleni care about theater, so the fact that the company has put work into this production with her literally means the world. She’s ridiculously thankful for and proud of everyone involved in this show but especially all the new Dean’s Men, who now get to join one of her favorite communities of all time. The most European thing about Eleni is her all-consuming desire to forfeit her American citizenship, return to the homeland, forget how to speak English, and never be heard from again.
    - name: Joseph DePaula
      role: Co-Dramaturg
      bio: is a third-year Medieval Studies & History major making his assistant-directorial debut with this production of Much Ado (and he is honored to have been given such a great opportunity to learn from Eleni!). He made his college stage-managerial debut last year with Cup of Theater’s BELEARIC, though he is primarily an actor—having performed in “Strings Attached” (UT); "The Taming of the Shrew" (Dean's Men); "Dead Fun Society" (UT); "The Physicists" (CoT); and "Marian, or the True Tale of Robin Hood" (UT) during his time at UChicago so far. Joseph also serves as the Artistic Director for Cup of Theater, the Production Manager & Co-Outreach Coordinator for Attori Senza Paura (the Commedia dell'Arte troupe on campus), and Co-Outreach Chair for University Theater Committee. His most European trait is probably all of the Italian-Americanisms he picked up from his family—as a younger sibling, he can say some men choose to be a stunadi, while others have it thrust upon them.
    - name: Coco Liu
      role: Production Manager
      bio: is a fourth-year Chemistry and Linguistics major. She has previously worked on The Taming of the Shrew (Production Manager), Strings Attached (Co-Stage Manager), and Macbeth in Space (Production Manager). Her most European trait is being from a former British colony and therefore doing things like using the metric system, calling trash cans "bins", and not understanding why cars are everywhere. 
    - name: Nate LePelley
      role: Stage Manager
      bio: is a second-year Cognitive Science major. He has previously worked on Strings Attached (Assistant Stage Manager). He would like to thank any of his friends that came to watch this production and to Eleni for giving him the opportunity to prove his stage-manager chops. His most European trait is his hatred for American politics and his love of pączkis.
    - name: Cami Delgado
      role: Lighting Designer
      bio: is a second year Astrophysics and Visual Arts Major. They have previously worked on Taming of the Shrew (Assistant Lighting Designer), Richard III (Lighting Designer), and The Play That Goes Wrong (Assistant Stage Manager).

    - name: Maddy Tavel
      role: Sound Designer
      bio: is a second-year English and Computer Science major. In UT she has worked on Winter Workshops (Sound Designer) and Midsummer (Assistant Sound Designer).

    - name: Will Rehmus
      role: Scenic Designer
      bio: is a second-year astrophysics major. They have worked on 4 UT mainstage shows so far (in sound, lighting, and stage management), and on a number of other other projects (T[24], workshops, Arcadia). They have really enjoyed diving into the world where this show is set and creating a design to reflect that. The most European thing about them is that they spell things the british way about 65% of the time.
    - name: Kaiden Wu
      role: Props Designer
      bio: is currently "borrowing" more oranges from the dining hall for this show (allegedly). His most European trait is that he somewhat knows English.

      bio: is a first year planning to major in Fundamentals; Issues and Texts and Classical studies. This is her first time working in a theater production!
