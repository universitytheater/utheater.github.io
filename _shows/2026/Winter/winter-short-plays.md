- title: The Burden of Burial
  subheader: Sophocles' Antigone Reimagined
  author: Courtney Pine
  description: "Sophocles' Antigone transformed into a musical: The Burden of Burial. Antigone is an Ancient Greek play about a young woman who decides to bury her brother, going against King Creon's decree to do what she believes is right. The driving question is “how does the concept of kinship and familial duty drive individual actions under a feminist lens?” Themes include family, sisterhood, rebellion, and the juxtaposition between pride (King Creon’s desire to maintain an appearance of strength) and duty (Antigone’s need to protect her brothers even after death)."

- title: El Cepillo de Dientes
  author: José Díaz
  description: <i>El Cepillo de Dientes</i> is a 1960’s Chilean play that navigates the middle class’s futile search for meaning in marriage with an absurdist lens. From bizarre fantasy games to exaggerated conflict over the simplest objects, this play is a whirlwind of humor and sharp criticism of gender roles, routine, power, and relationships. The text has been translated into English but will maintain Latin American cultural elements.
