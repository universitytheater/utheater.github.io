description: '<p>When two eleven-year-old boys face an altercation on the playground,
  two sets of Brooklyn parents meet in hopes of clean resolution, but what ensues
  is nothing short of a total catastrophe. Through her masterful script, Yasmina Reza
  tests the limits of language, prejudice, and the human breaking point. Experience
  this captivating and chilling Tony-award winning drama about what it means to fight
  for your beliefs.</p><h4 class="mt-2 mb-2">Cast</h4> <p><span data-sheets-userformat="0}"
