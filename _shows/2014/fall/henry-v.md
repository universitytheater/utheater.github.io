  <p><span class="small_text_a">The Dean's Men play "the King's Men" in Jon Sorce's production of Henry V.  A ragtag chorus of Shakespearean players takes our stage and introduces our story: the defense of a dynasty under newly-crowned King Henry.  Just as the brave new monarch prepares to win an impossible victory against the French, the brave players prepare to perform and impossible spectacle with only a few blocks and some moxy.  Wars will wage, bombast will blast, and your spirits will most certainly rouse.</span></p> <p>By <strong>William Shakespeare </strong><br/>
