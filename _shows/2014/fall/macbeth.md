description: "<p>Dreams can contaminate the day and in\_\xC9amon Boylan's\_Macbeth,\
  \ the wilds outside are something of a dream. Driven mad by the normative imperatives\
  \ of a waking world, Macbeth and Lady Macbeth want self-fulfillment and happiness\
  \ at any cost. Weird words affirm their ambition, and they decide to kill the normativity\
  \ opressing them. A brutal mixture of Shakespearean verse and German Expressionist\
  \ gesture and movement,\_Macbeth\_will murder sleep. Maybe yours.</p> <p>By <strong>William\
