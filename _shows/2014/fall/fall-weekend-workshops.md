description: "<p><em>A Weekend of Workshops</em> offers a stage to directors, devisers,\
  \ and performers hoping to exercise and explore their craft. This Fall our workshops\
  \ investigate every facet of the human experience. In <em>What a Wild Party!</em>\
  \ Itzel Blancas presents the flash and fluster of a prohibition era soiree in search\
  \ of sex and heartbreak. <em>Wild Thing</em>, directed and devised by Sarah Kim,\
  \ is a rambunctious take on a well-worn childhood story. David Goodman-Edberg directs\
  \ <em>Drowning</em>, a tender and puzzling tale of lost innocence. And in <em>Talk\
  \ to Me Like the Rain and Let Me Listen...</em> Adam Johnson shapes a bleary and\
  \ passionate couple's frayed wits and aimless love.</p><p>based on <em>The Wild\
