  Logan Center, Theater West</p> <p>The TAPS Acting Studio gathers student actors under professional direction to hone and showcase their skills. This year, jazz penetrates the sweltering New Orleans summer air in Tennessee Williams's classic <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em>. Desperate romanticism and determined realism collide when Stella's sister Blanche enters a home that Stanley considers his own. Love, understanding and compassion are clucked and clocked by inescapable truths and indomitable wills.
