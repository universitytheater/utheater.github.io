  \ and blank, waiting for an upload of true human intimacy.\_ But as four Londoners\
  \ seek and evade each other, flirting and flying through chatrooms and strip clubs,\
  \ honesty becomes a performance.\_ In a dense and tangled network, Alice, Anna,\
  \ Dan, and Larry capture and negotiate their many loves by any and all emotional\
  \ means.\_ And the London streets look more and more like a M\xF6bius strip.\_ Will\
  \ this loop return them to the truth?</span></p><p>by <strong>Patrick Marber</strong><br/>\n\
