  <p><em>A Weekend of Workshops</em> offers a stage to directors, devisers, and performers hoping to exercise and explore their craft. This Fall our workshops investigate every facet of the human experience. In <em>What a Wild Party!</em> Itzel Blancas presents the flash and fluster of a prohibition era soiree in search of sex and heartbreak. <em>Wild Thing</em>, directed and devised by Sarah Kim, is a rambunctious take on a well-worn childhood story. David Goodman-Edberg directs <em>Drowning</em>, a tender and puzzling tale of lost innocence. And in <em>Talk to Me Like the Rain and Let Me Listen...</em> Adam Johnson shapes a bleary and passionate couple's frayed wits and aimless love.</p><p>based on <em>The Wild Party</em> by <strong>Andrew Lippa</strong><br/>
