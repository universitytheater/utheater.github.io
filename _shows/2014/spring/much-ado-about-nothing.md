  \ this season's Much Ado About Nothing which features trickery, misinformation,\
  \ and interfering friends, all for the sake of romance. Two pairs of lovers are\

  \ sparring wits keep you on your toes, and Claudio and Hero, whose genuine feelings\
  \ are sweetly endearing. Springtime joy and camaraderie are guaranteed, and the\
