description: "<p><span class=\"small_text_a\">Every quarter,<em>\_A Weekend of Workshops</em>\
  \ allows\_directors to devise and stage big ideas on a small scale. This spring,\
  \ truth, or a lack thereof, is a matter of perspective. Victorian era British gentility\
  \ learns that its house may be on fire, literally. Poetry, sound, and movement create\
  \ the dissonance that may or may not be human nature. And the first lady of Argentina\
  \ may sing a different song than we expect. Alex Hearn directs <em>The Still Alarm</em>\
  \ by George Kaufman, Derek Spencer stages Harmony Korine's <em>A Crackup at the\
  \ Race Riots</em>, and Allie Garfinkle presents <em>A Little Star Quality: Scenes\
