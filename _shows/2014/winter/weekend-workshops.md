  <p><span class="small_text_a">Every quarter, Workshops give student directors the opportunity to stage big ideas in small ways. Productions are always constrained technically, but this quarter the focus is on other forms of constraint. Kayla Mathisen directs <em>No Exit</em> by Jean-Paul Sartre, where hell is a room full of strangers who may not be so strange. Maria Decker presents David Ives' <em>Sure Thing</em>, the tale of a romance which developes exactly according to plan. And <em>Springwood Centeral Honors Society</em> is a play written and directed by Christopher Deakin, about a student trapped in their diary and in the world of their youth.</span><br/>
