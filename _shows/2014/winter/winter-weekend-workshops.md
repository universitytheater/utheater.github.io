description: "<p><span class=\"small_text_a\">Every quarter, Workshops give student\
  \ directors the opportunity to stage big ideas in small ways. Productions are always\
  \ constrained technically, but this quarter the focus is on other forms of constraint.\
  \ Kayla Mathisen directs <em>No Exit</em> by Jean-Paul Sartre, where hell is a room\
  \ full of strangers who may not be so strange. Maria Decker presents David Ives'\
  \ <em>Sure Thing</em>, the tale of a romance which developes exactly according to\
  \ plan. And <em>Springwood Centeral Honors Society</em> is a play written and directed\
  \ by Christopher Deakin, about a student trapped in their diary and in the world\
  \ of their youth.</span><br/>\n\_</p><p>by\_<strong>Jean-Paul Sartre</strong><br/>\n\
