  ><span>UC Dancers\u2019 winter showcase an annual dance production consists of around\
  \ 10 dances, and runs about an hour. It is entirely student choreographed, with\
  \ the exception of one dance every year that is professionally choreographed by\
  \ a Chicago dance instructor. The dances range from duets to a piece performed by\
  \ the entire UC Dancers\u2019 company.</span></span></p><p dir=\"ltr\">\n<span>The\
  \ title and theme of this year\u2019s show is \u201CVoices.\u201D It examines the\
  \ way that we use expression. Each student choreographer is free to take the idea\
  \ of expression and weave it into their piece how every they see fit. The variety\
  \ styles and pacing of performances and the songs chosen to accompany each dance\
  \ will show how individuals can bring their own voice to a single mode of expression.\
  \ In line with this years \u201CVoices\u201D theme the performance this year will\
  \ also include one dance set to acappella music performed live at the show by the\
  \ UChicago Ransom Notes.</span></p><p><strong>\u201CSensations, feelings, insights,\
