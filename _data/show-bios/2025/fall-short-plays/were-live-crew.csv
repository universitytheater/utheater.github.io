"Brooklyn Myers","Sound","is a 3rd year Biology and HIPS major. She was an ASM in high school, but has not been part of any productions at UChicago until now. She thanks her friends for making her want to do theatre again, and her cat for waking her up in the morning. This experience has been unlike any other prodcution I have done. Decades from now, intellectuals will analyze not only the play itself, but the revolutionary production and reception of We're Live at UChicago in 2025. Imagine the scene in Ratattouille where the critic flashes back to his childhood. This has been an extremely profound experience."

They have previously worked on Cactus Flower (Associate Lighting Designer) Troilus and Cressida (Sound Designer), The Play That Goes Wrong (Lighting Designer); Strings Attached (Assistant Costume and Assistant Lighting Designer); Much Ado About Nothing (Assistant Scenic Designer); Arcadia (TAPS Pro-Show) (Lighting Programmer and Board Operator); Muscle Memory (Lighting Designer); and six Theater [24]s (Lighting/Sound Designer). Their most profound experience on this show was coming to terms with the inescapable and infinite passing of time."
"Giancarlo Beritela","Committee Liaison","stopped filling out bio forms in Fall 2024. We are unsure if this is a political statement or personal choice."
