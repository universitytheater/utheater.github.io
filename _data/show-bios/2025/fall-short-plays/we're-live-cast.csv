"Joshua Federman","Ky","is a second-year Math major. This is his UT debut, and he has previously performed in productions of The Tempest, Henry V, Hamlet, As You Like It, Macbeth, 12th Night, The Winter's Tale, Julius Caesar, and After This Episode. He has read two novels titled after Macbeth quotes. His most profound experience working on this show was watching his director recite a particularly moving 25-minute passage from The Odyssey in the original Greek."
"Carrie Semmel","Amanda","is a third-year Political Science and Psychology major. She has previously performed for Cactus Flower (Customer and Waiter). In the rehearsal room, she has profoundly discovered the cure to cancer, thanks to her fellow cast."
"Maxwell Beck","Dr. Esquire","is a first year prospective Sociology and Philosophy major. He has previously performed in Radio Play Disaster (Furious Hamster); The Wong Kids in the Secret of the Space Chupacabra Go! (The Great Prognosticator); YAMO '65, '66, and '67 (various roles);  Urinetown (Old Man Strong); Matilda (Nigel); and Candide (The Baroness). Throughout the production of this play, he discovered the true meaning of life: working with others to putt something together from scratch, and SMASHING THAT SUBSCRIBE BUTTON!"
"Lavanya Gupta","Minny","is a second-year Physical Chemistry major. This is her first time working with UT and she was really excited to call basically everyone she has interacted with at this college to opening night. Over the course of the play, she single-handedly kept the audio industry afloat â€” snapping three pairs of wired headphones (one pair somehow made it through a laundry cycle) and somehow also managing to murder a perfectly innocent pair of wireless ones for good measure."
"Gavin Robalino","Oscar","is a third-year Comparative Human Development and English major. He profoundly learned the true meaning of friendship in the rehearsal room."
