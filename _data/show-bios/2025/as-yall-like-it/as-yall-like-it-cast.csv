Lexie Vogel,Rosalind,"is a staff member at the University of Chicago in the Department of Romance Languages and Literatures. She loves theatre and this show marks her 36th production and second time in As You Like It! Her recent credits include House of Desires (Celia), 5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche (Ginny/Dale), and Julius Caesar (Soothsayer/Cinna the Poet)! In a Western film, Lexie's horse would be named Elsa/Elsinore after the character in Kristin Hannah's novel The Four Winds. (It is a very heart-wrenching book set during the Dust Bowl/Great Depression, please take this recommendation with caution.⚠️) Lexie hopes the play may please!"
Maela Mazzone,Orlando,"is a first year, and is so excited to be in As Ya’ll Like It. In high school, Maela’s favorite performances were Beauty and the Beast (Belle), The Crucible (Abigail), The Prom (Alyssa), and The Play That Goes Wrong (Robert). If they were in a Western, Maela would struggle with choosing their horse’s name, but some possible contenders include Casper the Friendly Horse, Peppa Horse, May the Horse Be With You, or (their personal favorite), Roy. They would like to thank their dad for helping them come up with these horse names, their mom, who laughed even though she thought the names were stupid, and the incredibly supportive cast and crew of this show."
Alex Flores,Jaques & Le Beau,"is a fourth year MENG major and TAPS minor. He has previously worked on The Arsonists (Policeman/Dr. of Philosophy) and The Tempest (Alonso). For reasons he cannot articulate, he thinks Tailgate would be the perfect name for a horse."
Robert Stimpson,Celia,"is a Third Year Sociology and Comparative Human Development Major, and the lead archivist of Dean’s Men History. With UT he has played Leonato in Much Ado About Nothing, Gonzalo in the Tempest, danced in 35mm, and played Dallas Richman (not Richmond) in Strings Attached, so while this not his first time playing a character in cowboy boots, it is his first time playing a woman. He would like to thank the coincidences of casting that made this possible, the Dean’s Men for their scintillating past, and all of the members of his family who are coming to watch! He would name his horse Sven (like from frozen) or Cliff because it’s cool."

Kati Langille,Duke Senior & Charles,is in her 4th year at the University of Chicago. She studies English Literature and performed in The Play that Goes Wrong (Annie) in 2024. She is happy to be here. 
Lola Flores,Duke Frederick & Audrey,"is a 4th year Classics major. This is her first UT and Dean's Men show, but is wondering if she can get half credit for performing in the Romeo and Juliet ballet. In an ideal Western film, she would have a horse named Mystery just like Spongebob."
