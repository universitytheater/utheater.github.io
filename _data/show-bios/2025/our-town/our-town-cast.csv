Ariadne Merchant,"Joe & Si Crowell","is a third-year Psychology and Linguistics major. In UT she has previously played Jason in “Falsettos”, and before that was in a production of “Suessical the Musical” playing the role of Jojo. So it’s easy to say this isn’t Ariadne’s first rodeo playing a young boy whose name starts with “j” in a stage production. She loves a good laugh and enjoys being part of the magic of theater. If she were a ghost, the one thing she would most miss about being alive would be the feeling of a crisp autumn breeze on her face during her morning bike ride. She would also miss cracking jokes with her friends while watching movies late at night."
Clovis Layrisson,Howie Newsome & Wally Webb,"is a first-year student. This is their first UT credit. They are jazzed to be in Our Town. If I was a ghost, one thing I would NOT miss is the dinning hall food."

In UT, she has previously worked on “If/Then” (Vocal Director), “Strings Attached” (Violin II), and the Winter Workshop “Queen of Spades” (Tomsky).

Maggie Banks,Mrs. Webb,"is a second-year MENG major. In UT, she's performed in If/Then (Chorus) and Royal Flush (Cassie). Outside of UT, she has played such featured roles as a door (A Tale of Two Cities). If she was a ghost, she would miss cross stitching."

Before UT, she’s been performed in Bitter Within (Sarah), Everybody (Everybody), Peter and the Star Catcher (Molly), Dancing at Lughnasa (Chris), and Puffs (Uncle Dave). If she were a ghost she would miss wearing warm fresh laundry in winter. "
Maya Bond,Emily Webb,"Maya, a second year TAPS major, is so excited to be in Our Town! Though she may have peaked in the unforgettable Theater[24] production, It's A Doggy-Dog World And Dog We Eat, you may have also seen her in last year's TAPS Pro-Show as Thomasina Coverly or the Spring 2025 Dean's Men show as Miranda. You might not know that she has also spent many hours toiling away in the FXK booth. If Maya was a ghost, she would miss ...sunsets and swimming ...coffee and walks. "

Jack Getz,Simon Stimson,"is a student in Public Policy and Anthropology. He has previously worked on the Laramie Project and Marian: or the True Tale of Robin Hood. Above anything else, he’d miss the water: a deep drink on a warm day, a light rain with a gentle breeze, or a dive down beneath the waves."

Last year in UT she performed as Kate in If/Then and a vocalist in 35mm, and other previous favorite roles include Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet, Berthe in Pippin, and Hope in Urinetown.
