He'd like to thank the whole of this lovely company, in particular Sara & Maya, but absolutely everyone did amazing, and he's so thankful to have worked with them! And, of course, his wonderful roommates Emily & Rachel, for their help throughout this process! His fake family is comprised of 7 singing children: Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl. They tour the world with their delightful rhythms and harmonies being enjoyed by all, and he is in talks of adapting their story to stage & film (title TBD)."
Zachary Leiter,Choreographer,"is a fourth year studying political science and TAPS.

Eleni Lefakis,Dramaturg,"is a fourth-year TAPS and RLLT double-major and former UT Treasurer. Her UT mainstage credits are The Heirs (Stage Manager); The Trail to Oregon!

Eleni cannot overstate how delighted she is to have THE Joseph DePaula directing the only UT show she's ever acted in and her fake husband is the closeted gay heir to a Greek shipping empire. Their lavender marriage has produced two beautiful children, a boy and a girl, via surrogacy, and their prenup states that in the event of a divorce she gets the kids, the mansion in Ekali, the megayacht, the Paros island beach house, and the membership to the Tatoi Club."
