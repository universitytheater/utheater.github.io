In UT, she has previously played Jason in the musical “Falsettos”, and Joe and Si in the play “Our Town”. Her favorite figure from Greek mythology would definitely not be Theseus (for reasons that should be obvious because her name is Ariadne); her favorite figure is Demeter because without her there would be no change of seasons and Ariadne absolutely adores when summer becomes autumn (her favorite season).

He also enjoys spending his time running, exploring Chicago, and hanging out with friends. As an oldest child who calls the East Coast home, Julian’s favorite character from Greek mythology, is only naturally, Poseidon. "
