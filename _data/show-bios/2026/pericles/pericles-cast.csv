He has previously appeared in The Arsonists (Policeman/Dr. of Philosophy), The Tempest (Alonso), and As Y’all Like It (Le Beau/Jaques).

2/6/2026 22:55:18,Lavanya Gupta,Gower,is a second-year Physical Chemistry major. She has previously worked on We're Live! (Minny) and a lesbian wedding (Theatre 24). Her worst travel experience was when she was stranded at the Frankfurt airport for 27 hours while flying to chicago - with no carry on. Just her headphones and four balls of wool and no knitting needles because they're apparently a security hazard.

2/2/2026 17:19:28,Fimi Adesemoye,"Dionyza, Thaisa, & Daughter","is a third-year Psychology and Business Economics major. Within UT, she has previously read for a Staged Reading and performed in Richard III (Elizabeth). She's also worked on shows such as Annie, Rebel without A Cause, and Midsummer Night's Dream as both Cast and Crew. She's back from an almost 2-year acting hiatus (yay!) and very excited to be working on another Dean's Men production. Topping her relatively small list of bad travel experiences would be the 5 day ""road trip"" her family went on when moving from North Platte, Nebraska to Vancouver, British Columbia. Can you imagine being stuck in the middle row of a Honda Pilot as a 13-year-old with a 10-year brother and a 4-year-old sister?"
1/29/2026 16:36:09,Himanshu Sahore,"Simonides, Lychorida, & Lysimachus","is a second-year History major. He's previously performed for UT in Our Town (Sam Craig), and this is his first Dean's Men show. He would like to thank the cast and crew for making the process of putting the show together so fun and rewarding. His worst travel story is having to do a full-day guided tour of Madrid on two hours of plane sleep. "

1/29/2026 22:11:42,Christine Hignite,"Fisherman, Knight, Pirate, & Bawd","is a first-year (undecided but potentially) English and TAPS major. This is her first UT/Dean’s Men show and she is so grateful to have met everyone in the cast and crew and to have been part of this process! She has been acting for most of her life, but her other hobbies include writing, singing, watching bad movies, and doing improv with Occam’s Razor. Her worst travel experience is that on the underwater train from Paris to London, she was served a delicious tart topped with a round greenish fruit that she cannot identify to this day. It haunts her."
