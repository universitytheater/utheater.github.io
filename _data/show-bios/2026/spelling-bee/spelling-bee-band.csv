He would love to win the bee on the abbreviation SPEBSQSA (the old name of the Barbershop Harmony Society), but  if he had to choose a word for realsies, he’d pick a funny sounding word, like zeugma. Or chicken. Chicken is a great word"
1/11/2026 21:51:27,Loula Barnes,Percussion,"is a second-year Public Policy major, perhaps with a minor in physics. In her first year, she drummed for UT's productions of If/Then and 35mm; you can also find her drumming in the UChicago Jazz Ensemble and the Dirt Red Brass Band. She'd want to win the spelling bee on the word ""paradiddle,"" the thing that got her into drumming for the first time when she discovered it as a 10-year-old at summer camp."

She would want to win the bee on the word ""chassis"" since her own 5th grade spelling bee journey ended on misspelling that word."
