1/7/2026 21:58:31,Jac Davies,"Chip, Jesus, & Olive’s Dad","is a first year and is planning on studying Biology and Chemistry (maybe). This is his first UT show, but he has been doing theatre in his home town of Olathe, Kansas for years. Some of his previous roles include Beast in Beauty and the Beast, Orin in Little Shop of Horrors, Emmett in Legally Blonde, and Ms. Trunchbull in Matilda. He’s very grateful and would like to thank the whole cast, crew, and creative team for all their support and welcoming spirit for his first UT show! He’d love to win the bee on the word ‘unnecessary’ because he’s never spelled that word right before, and it would make him feel very good. "
