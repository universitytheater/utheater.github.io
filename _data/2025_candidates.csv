alasdair@uchicago.edu,Alasdair Dodd,he/him,"Hi! I'm Alasdair, a third year EALC and Religious Studies major. Since my second year, I've been very involved in UT, as a lighting designer, stage manager, and production manager. My full list of credits is: Falsettos (LD); A Midsummer Night's Dream (SM); Royal Flush (workshop, SM); The Arsonists (LD); Troilus and Cressida (co-PM). I am extremely grateful to UT for giving me a purpose and space of joy at UChicago and wish to run for committee so I can improve and give back to UT for future students. Additionally, I have experienced firsthand the power of UT committee in making tangible, beneficial change, and would love an opportunity to continue this next year. Some goals I want to focus on include encouraging first year participation (as both actors and designers), increasing communication between UT and the Dean's Men and other performance-oriented RSOs, and streamlining the production process between TAPS Pro-Staff and UT.

apetry@uchicago.edu,August Petry,they/them,"Hi! My name is August Petry, and I am a first year majoring in TAPS and Math. The past two quarters I have been the Assistant Director of If/Then (mainstage), where I have been in the rehearsal room every day and fallen in love with UT. My priority has been If/Then these past two quarters, but I also directed a staged reading (Raisel and the Ibbur) in the fall, am signed on to The Tempest (Assistant Production Manager) and Cactus Flower (Assistant Lighting Designer) for the spring, and am excited for the chance to be involved in every aspect of the production process! I would be eager to be on committee to get more involved in the administrative side of UT, especially as I aim to go into theater administration professionally, as well as give back to the incredible UT community! I fell in love with theater management as the executive producer of my theater in high school, and I would be excited to once again be involved in the administrative side.  On committee, I would have several primary goals, the first being to expand the Staged Readings. When I participated in this fall’s staged reading, I really loved the experience, but think the readings could benefit from a more organized structure, with increased communication between directors and writers. I'd be eager to help run staged readings to make sure they can occur every quarter, as well as in a way that allows us to truly do justice to the scripts. I'd additionally like to work to increase marketing and outreach at the start of the year, in particular regarding auditions; many people (in particular first years) do not know how they can get involved in UT, or don’t find out we exist until after auditions are done, so I would love to brainstorm ways to ensure people know how to get involved! Secondarily, I would hope to work with committee to increase collaboration with other arts RSOs and organize more trips to see local Chicago theater. I would be excited to dedicate this next year to any and all committee responsibilities and the betterment of UT, and I hope to have the opportunity to serve on committee this year. Thank you for your consideration!"
cjpressey@uchicago.edu,Clara Pressey,she/her,"Hello! My name is Clara Pressey, and I am a first year prospective TAPS and something else (as of yet undecided) major. My UT credits include Theater[24] this quarter and last quarter (as a writer and an actor respectively). I am also a member of the performing generation of Off-Off Campus and an avid Shakespearience-enjoyer.While my current role in Off-Off prohibits me from participating in mainstage productions for the next two quarters, I can't wait until I can, and I can not adequately express my enthusiasm for UT. From the moment I stepped onto campus, UT members have been some of the friendliest people I've had the good fortune to meet. But just as it is a warm community, UT is also an artistically vibrant one. I can hardly articulate the depth of dedication, enthusiasm, and artistry I have seen poured into every UT show and event. This dedication to the performing arts makes UT a vital part of life on campus, and one in which I'd like to be as involved as humanly possible. As someone who has aspirations in theater, I would take my role in Committee very seriously. I have experience with performing, stage managing, and directing. This variety of experience, along with my passion for theater, would allow me to step into a number of roles and contribute in a number of ways. I know that serving on UT would also be an invaluable learning experience. UT is important, and I want to play whatever part I can in helping it flourish. Thank you, and I'll see you around! Say hi to me, I need friends."
emcurran@uchicago.edu,Emily Curran,she/her,"Hi everyone! For those who don’t know me, I’m Emily. I’m a current third year Public Policy major and TAPS minor. I have served as UT Committee Social Chair for the past year and am excited to run for Committee again! Being on Committee has been a wonderful experience. We have made some amazing changes to the way we do theater and I am thrilled to have the opportunity to continue the work we have begun. I have never known a quarter off from UT and I would love to keep it that way through the rest of my time at the College! On individual shows, I have served as a lighting designer, actor, and (most recently) an assistant director. I am well versed in how UT functions, but am keen to listen to new folks on how we can make the process smoother. If you’ve made it this far in the statement, thank you! I hope to keep serving the UT community through service on Committee and look forward to all the progress we will make."
gberitela@uchicago.edu,Giancarlo Beritela,he/him,"As a third-year student in the College, I’ve been involved in UT every quarter bar one. I’ve also served on what will be the previous iteration of UT committee as Co-Outreach Chair. I think as someone now familiar with not just UT as a whole but the workings of committee, I would be a valuable addition to the team, picking up from where I left off!"
dmkaden@uchicago.edu,Kaden Kaden,she/he/they,"Hi!! My name is Kaden Kaden (yes, first name: Kaden, last name: Kaden). I'm a second year now, but I've been involved with UT since pretty much the moment I set foot on this campus and started my time as a student here. I got brought into this crew of lovely people through Theater [24] and then doing the lighting design for Muscle Memory last fall. Since then I've worked on quite a few shows (13 if you count T [24], 8 if you don't). I can proudly say I have experience working on UT shows in almost every design discipline. I've really enjoyed getting to explore so many different mode of creative expression through theater, my time spent with UT has most definitely been one of the brightest spots in my college experience so far.As someone who has worked exclusively as a designer, never as management or as an actor, I have a really strong understanding of how design in UT operates. I would love to improve the support network for new designers, because breaking into UT design can be daunting and confusing. I want to join committee so that I can put my experience to use in ways that will benefit the UT community long-term. P.S. Look, you know me, vote for me (please please please please pretty please like cmon man please)"
nshimo@uchicago.edu,Nayu Shimo,she/they,"Hi! I'm Nayu and I'm a second-year here at UChicago studying some combination of Gender and Sexuality Studies, Religious Studies, and TAPS. Throughout my two+ years (it's a bit complicated), I've been part of five TAPS productions: Welcome Back To My Channel (assistant director), Fall 2024 Staged Readings (actor), The Arsonists (assistant stage manager), If/Then (assistant production manager), and Troilus and Cressida (co-stage manager.) I'll also be stage managing 35mm: A Musical Exhibition and sound designing Cactus Flower this Spring 2025! I would like to join committee first, because I want to learn about and further be apart of supporting the theater community at large here at UChicago. As someone who is both new yet (somewhat) old within the realm of UT, I believe there are ways that can make introducing first-years and people not currently involved in theater become more involved in an accessible way. I know there are nooks and crannies of theater that can seem intimidating to someone who is brand new at it and I believe that committee can further help to ease those anxieties and encourage people to join the theater community. Second, I would like to focus on expanding the hold space library and finding concrete ways to encourage productions by non-white and non-male writers. While there have been some positive changes since my first year, I still find that the vast majority of productions we put on are by white, male playwrights, which limits the diversity and representation on our stages. I am committed to advocating for productions that feature diverse casts and playwrights, and I want to work collaboratively with my peers to brainstorm strategies that can make this a reality. Specifically, I hope to use the proposal process to support and promote these diverse voices, ensuring that our programming reflects a broader range of experiences and perspectives and truly embraces inclusion in all aspects of production.Finally, I would like to continue working on fostering a stronger and more positive relationship with TAPs pro-staff. In recent years, our interactions with the TAPs pro-staff have been somewhat rocky, and I recognize the importance of repairing and improving this relationship moving forward. Building trust and open communication is essential for a smooth collaborative environment, and I am committed to supporting initiatives and actions that will help bridge any gaps and strengthen our partnership. By focusing on mutual respect and shared goals, I hope to contribute to creating a more cohesive and effective working relationship with TAPs pro-staff for the benefit of everyone involved."
rachelbolte@uchicago.edu,Rachel Bolte,she/her,"Hi all! I'm Rachel, a third-year studying sociology and German. I've been officially involved in UT since the end of my second year, but I've been a fan of UT almost since day one (having HUM with Emily Curran will do that to you). UT has brought me a lot of joy and many of my closest friendships; given me the opportunity to do the things I'm good at (spreadsheets and sending reminder emails!) in service of fun and rewarding projects (namely Play that Goes Wrong and The Arsonists); and to push myself out of my comfort zone, as I'm now acting for the first time in Thirteenth Morning. As a committee member, my priority would be helping UT keep up the things it does well: creating a true community of performers and artists on campus and putting on consistently high-quality productions (which is no small feat for anyone, much less UChicago students). I'd also like to see us as an organization address some common sticking points in productions, which might include building in support for cast/crew NEDs and committee liaisons in the form of conflict-resolution training, updating our interpretations of the CTS to make sure our organization is supportive of and empowering its members.Thank you for your consideration!"
rdstimpson@uchicago.edu,Robert Stimpson,he/him,"I have performed in two UT shows. The first, Strings Attached, was a cross-quarter musical written by Jeff Lind. I auditioned for Strings because Jeff asked me to, and by the time that show ended, I was hooked. I have since performed in Much Ado About Nothing with the Dean's Men and in Theatre 24. After that experience with the Dean's Men I wrote a sociological exploration on how the Dean's Men and UT play in the arts community and broader culture on this campus. The jist of my argument said that the strong community built by UT empowers people and strengthens love for the arts on this campus. I would like to play a role in managing that community and spreading that love."
wfox@uchicago.edu,Weston Fox,he/him,"Hi! I'm Weston Fox (he/him) and I'm a first year here majoring in TAPS and Environmental Science. I've been involved with UT's Theater[24] this quarter and last as both an actor and as a writer, and am currently part of Off-Off Campus. I've also participated in the Shakespeariences (ask me about my Cressida)!Theater has been a huge part of my life (amongst family, lemonade, and books), and I've tried my best to interact with it in as many different ways as presented to me. I've spent a lot of time as an actor,  recently been involved in writing - from sketches to plays - done stage crew and lighting, and tried my hand at directing. Even though Off-Off has prevented me from involving myself more, I'm so genuinely excited about participating in the UT community in my future years. Everyone I've interacted with from UT (through Theater[24], after shows, or in class) has been so bright and warm and welcoming, only matched by the talent and intellect I've seen on display in every performance. It's a true hub on campus for artists, and I'd love to provide help in any way I can.I'm committed to doing what I can to help UT thrive even more in the future. My past experience managing performance venues, acts, and other logistics within a theater organization would serve me well with UT, and I'm dedicated to putting those skills to good use. I'm ready and willing to help in whatever way is needed, and I hope to learn more about UT and theater with you all. Wave hi if you see me! Thank you!"
willrehmus@uchicago.edu,Will Rehmus,he/him,"Hi! I'm Will (they/them), a second-year Astro major/TAPS minor. I have been on UT Committee for a year and have learned a lot. I think that my experience, both organizationally and technically, would be very beneficial for Committee next year. I have a few main goals for the term. One is to continue building our relationship with TAPS, which has been improving significantly, but is still somewhat strained. Another is to improve the infrastructure and communication of UT. A lot of things would be easier if information was easier to access, more timely, and presented in a more readable format. I have been on the crew of 8 shows: Cassandra (Lighting & Sound Designer), Muscle Memory (Asst. Lighting Designer), Falsettos (Asst. Stage Manager), Strings Attached (Co-Sound Designer), The Play That Goes Wrong (Asst. Lighting Designer), Arcadia [TAPS Pro-Show] (AME) Much Ado About Nothing (Scenic Designer), and Troilus and Cressida (Asst. Sound Designer). I also have been involved in Theater[24] 4 times, am currently Committee Liaison for 13th Morning, and will be on Cactus Flower (Lighting Designer) in the spring."
