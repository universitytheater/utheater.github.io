    <strong>A devised work inspired by the eponymous text, by Charles Mee<br/>

    Directed by Alexander Eichner &amp; Sarah Kim</strong></p><p>

    House of Cards was an experimental piece of site-specific performance art, devised
    with the designers and cast and staged in the Ida Noyes Cloister Club using tents
    to create close, intimate spaces. The original text is a meandering walk through
    the memories and musings of the speaker in a surreal dreamscape, vacillating between
    sweet, tender recollections and violent images of trauma. Working closely with
    the text, we devised a series of vignettes capturing aspects of the text with
    sound, lights, movement, and voice. We presented these pieces in various different
    orders to small groups, led from tent to tent through the vast, dark, and empty
    Cloister Club.</p><p>
