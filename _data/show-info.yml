  description: "King Ferdinand of Navarre’s “no fun” edict mandates scholarly endeavors, quiet contemplation and complete commitment to chastity for three entire years. His closest courtiers reluctantly sign on. But in true comedic fashion the arrival of the French Princess and her beautiful entourage quickly causes the would-be scholars to realize that the whole endeavor was a bad idea, with each votary trying to find a way to skirt the laws they themselves wrote. The young men’s studies soon give way to secret letters and amorous vows as the women set out to teach the men a thing or two about love and commitment. The puns fly and the playwright’s wordplay take flight in this playful romantic comedy about young love with a surprising conclusion where the characters' new outlooks on life are tested. <br><div class=\"video-player-wrapper\"><iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/653270391?h=7d9911e5af&byline=0&portrait=0\" class=\"video-player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js\"></script>"

    <strong>A devised work inspired by the eponymous text, by Charles Mee<br/>

    Directed by Alexander Eichner &amp; Sarah Kim</strong></p><p>

    House of Cards was an experimental piece of site-specific performance art, devised
    with the designers and cast and staged in the Ida Noyes Cloister Club using tents
    to create close, intimate spaces. The original text is a meandering walk through
    the memories and musings of the speaker in a surreal dreamscape, vacillating between
    sweet, tender recollections and violent images of trauma. Working closely with
    the text, we devised a series of vignettes capturing aspects of the text with
    sound, lights, movement, and voice. We presented these pieces in various different
    orders to small groups, led from tent to tent through the vast, dark, and empty
    Cloister Club.</p><p>
