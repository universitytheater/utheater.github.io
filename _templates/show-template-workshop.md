  - Join us for this quarter's Short Play Showcase! Every fall and winter quarter, we produce one or more short plays, often student-written. These shows are a great opportunity to get involved at a lower level of commitment. If you're interested in being a part of a future short play, subscribe to the UT General Listhost.
