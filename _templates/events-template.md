# This file is a template for event pages. For specific examples, the event pages for Fall 2025 and Winter 2026 should follow this format (ish).

# Files created with this template should go in _events/[INSERT YEAR], and follow the naming conventions of the other events pages. 
# To set your page as the defaul events page, change the redirect field in _pages/events. 

# I have included one detailed general template, followed by several common types of events. These are kind of examples and kind of templates, since the are basically the same thing in this context

# To avoid confusion, please delete this set of comments when making your page.

# Happy Editing! - Will

    description: >- # This can be more than one line if you want, and should be in markdown formatting.
      EVENT DESCRIPTION HERE 
    time: TIME # This doesn't need to follow any particular format, just do what you think conveys the time(s) that the event will take place. 
    end_time: END TIME # This DOES need to be in a machine-readable format. This is how the website filters out past events, so set this as the time that you want the event to stop appearing in the upcoming events section. e.g. 'Jan 6 2026, 10pm' or '2026-01-06 22:00'
    location: LOCATION & LINK # Use markdown link formatting if you want to include a link to a location page or a google maps page.
    links: # Inlude whatever links you think are useful here. Try to keep it to 2 or 3 at most. links can either be full urls or shorthand for internal links (e.g. /shows/2026/spelling-bee). 
    # If you don't have the link yet, you can comment out the line, which will make it easier to ad the link when you get it. (see link 3)
      LINK TEXT 1: LINK ADDRESS 1
      LINK TEXT 2: LINK ADDRESS 2
