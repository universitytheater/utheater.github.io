Richard III finds himself unsuited for the sudden peace of his brother’s rule and embroils himself in a net of schemes, seductions, and murders in order to achieve the throne. Follow the epic rise and fall of one of history’s most notorious villains against the backdrop of an anxious society torn apart by three decades of civil war. As the story unfolds, we are faced with an uncomfortable question: How can we secure a future for ourselves when we cannot escape the past?</p><p>
