    <p class="mt-3"><p>Weekend of Workshops offers a stage to directors, devisers and performers hoping to exercise and explore their craft. This Fall, directors choose moments which probe our relationship with danger. In <em>The Fear</em>, Guatama Mehta uses Robert Frost’s text to face the things that go bump in the night.  Lexi Turner imagines life in the wake of violent acts in <em>Women on Trial</em>. In <em>Almondseed/Almondella </em>Christian-Nicholas Castro Romero confronts the limits of ambition. Coriander Mayer’s <em>The Candles </em>examines the world of Moby Dick. Jackson Ruzzo ponders death, destiny, and the nature of humanity in <em>Variations on the Death of Trotsky.</em></p><p> </p> <p>Written by <strong>Robert Frost</strong><br/>
