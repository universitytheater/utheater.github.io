    <p class="mt-3"><p>Cruelty is mundane and everyone is claustrophobic in Samuel Beckett's <em>Endgame</em>, directed by Julia Santha.  A bare interior confines four humans, protecting them from a quiet apocalypse outside.  Language lacerates and longs in quick succession, as a game of minimums unfolds between the characters, each of them desperate for ways to pass their time.  Depression gives way to comedy gives way to more lust for life than you came with. </p><p>By <strong>Samuel Beckett</strong><br/>
