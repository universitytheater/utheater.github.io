The UT-General email listhost is a general listhost for communicating with the entire University Theater community and its audiences, moderated by UT Committee Chair and University Theater/Theater and Performance Studies Managing Director. Publicity for shows, audition and election information, Committee minutes, and weekly happenings regularly go out via this listhost. If you want to know what's going on in the University of Chicago theater world – events, opportunities, and people – this is the place. General community members are also welcome to email the listhost and tap into the vast theater community and its resources with any legitimate needs or calls.

### Joining the Listhost

In order to join the listhost, log in using your cnet ID and password at [lists.uchicago.edu](http://lists.uchicago.edu) and go to [https://lists.uchicago.edu/web/subscribe/utheater-general](lists.uchicago.edu/web/subscribe/utheater-general). 

If you do not know the password associated with your cnet ID or email address, or if your alternate email address does not yet have a password associated with it, click the “First login?” link beneath the login boxes or go to https://lists.uchicago.edu/web/sendpasswd/ and enter the address (@uchicago.edu or otherwise) for which you need the password.

### Unsubscribing from the Listhost

In order to remove yourself from the listhost, log in using your cnet ID to http://lists.uchicago.edu and scroll down to find utheater-general in the left hand column. Once you click through to the page for the listhost, you will see an "Unsubscribe" option in the left column. That will allow you to remove yourself from the listhost.

Alternatively, once you have logged in with your cnet ID, simply go to https://lists.uchicago.edu/web/signoff/utheater-general, which should unsubscribe you. For all UChicago listhosts, the process for unsubscribing is the same.

As noted above, you may be subscribed to the listhost with an email address other than your @uchicago.edu address. If this is the case, follow the same instructions as above, but log in using your alternate address instead of your cnet ID. Once again, if you do not know the password associated with your alternate address, please click the "First login?" link beneath the login boxes or go to https://lists.uchicago.edu/web/sendpasswd/ to have a password emailed to you.
