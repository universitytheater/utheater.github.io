UT abides by [the University's health protocols](https://goforward.uchicago.edu/health-requirements) regarding COVID-19, and we strongly encourage community members to wear masks in indoor settings, including during auditions, rehearsals, and production meetings, in order to limit the spread of COVID-19 among company members. Please direct questions about in-person guidelines and resources to UT Committee ([ut-committee@uchicago.edu](mailto:ut-commitee@uchicago.edu)) and [TAPS Pro Staff](https://taps.uchicago.edu/people/staff).

Due to the ever-changing conditions surrounding COVID-19, additional restrictions for productions in the 2022-23 school year may include:

* Face coverings required for all actors, staff, and audience members when indoors
* Singing and dancing could be prohibited or limited
* Company members could be required to test for COVID-19 on a weekly basis
* Limited capacity for productions in the FXK Theater

Proposals should plan for the following scenarios:
<ol type="a">
  <li>In-person performances with no restrictions</li>
  <li>In-person performances with masking required</li>
  <li>Virtual stream with some in-person work, plus adhere to any University and <a href="https://leadership.uchicago.edu/registered-student-organizations/winter-quarter-2022-updates/">CLI COVID policies</a> at the time which could include masks and limited or no audience</li>
</ol>

Productions should also form contingency plans for when company members are unable to work in-person due to quarantining for COVID-19, particularly for tech and performance weeks.

All University Theater-hosted events are open to invitees who are compliant with UChicago and (when applicable) Logan Center vaccination requirements, and because of ongoing health risks, particularly to the unvaccinated, participants are expected to adopt the risk mitigation measures (masking and social distancing, etc.) appropriate to their vaccination status as advised by public health officials or to their individual vulnerabilities as advised by a medical professional. Any person who feels unwell or (a) has any COVID-19 Symptoms (b) has had a positive COVID-19 test in the past 10 days, or (c) has had close contact with anyone confirmed or suspected of having COVID-19 agrees not to come to the Logan Center. Public convenings may not be safe for all and carries a risk for contracting COVID-19, particularly for those unvaccinated. Participants will not know the vaccination status of others and should follow appropriate risk mitigation measures.
