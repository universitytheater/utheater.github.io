Created in 2015 by Lori Myers and Laura T. Fisher in collaboration with a group of Chicago theater artists, the Chicago Theatre Standards (CTS) is a document and tool for self-governance that seeks to nurture communication, safety, respect, and accountability in all participants at all levels of theatrical production. UT adopts the CTS wholeheartedly and is committed to holding ourselves to its standards, as well as to ensuring its values sit at the center of all levels of our practice. Read the CTS [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DrP9dPEwatbuK7W_P1mp1Eqd-7M5znEB/view?usp=sharing) or below! 

Feel lost? Every UT production begins with a comprehensive presentation of the CTS by the Committee Liaison, where they guide productions through best practices, and establish resources for conflict resolution.
