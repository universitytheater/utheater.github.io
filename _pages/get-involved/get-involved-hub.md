We're so excited that you're interested in UT! We have a wide range of programming, suited for people of all experience levels & time-committments. To stay in the loop about our events, shows, and opportunities, join one or more of our **[mailing lists](/listhosts)**. 

#### UT Mainstages
UT mainstages are UT's primary season of shows. Mainstages are our highest production-value and highest committment shows, and there are always a variety of roles, depending on experience and time-committment. 

We typically produce 7-10 mainstage shows per year, including 3 by [The Dean's Men](https://www.facebook.com/thedeansmen/) (our Shakespeare sub-organization).

**Get involved as an [actor](/get-involved/actors), [designer, or manager](/get-involved/designers-managers) or [propose a show](/get-involved/proposers)!**

#### Weekend of Workshops
Workshops are a place for shorter, often more experimental shows. They tend to have a more laid-back production atmosphere and lower time-committment while maintaining the drive and strong sense of community that make UT so special.

We typically produce 2-4 workshops per quarter in the fall and winter.

**Get involved as an [actor](/get-involved/actors), [designer, or manager](/get-involved/designers-managers) or [propose a show](/get-involved/proposers)!**

#### Theater[24]
At the beginning of every quarter, Theater[24] gathers to write, rehearse, design, and perform a set of all-new works, all within only 24 hours! Come for laughs, new friends, chaos, and fun!

#### Off-Off Campus
Off-Off Campus is the oldest student improvisational theater troupe in the country! Building on UChicago's history as the birthplace of improvisational and sketch comedy, Off-Off trains a new generation every year in the art of improv.
