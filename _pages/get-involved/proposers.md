The first step for any UT show is the proposal. Every year, UT invites all of its community members to propose a show that they think UT should put on. This typically means a show that you want to direct, but not necessarily! Anyone is welcome to submit a proposal for any show. We can't wait to hear your proposals!

The proposal process works slightly differently for UT Mainstages, UT Short Plays, and Dean's Men Mainstages; the processes for each are outlined below. 

These processes may vary lightly year-to-year, and while we will try to keep this up-to-date, it's a good idea to follow the instructions in the emails sent to the [UT General Listhost](/listhosts). More specific information about the broader proposal process can be found in the [bylaws](/bylaws#V-v-the-university-theater-proposal-process).

### Mainstage Proposals

The mainstage proposal process happens once every spring, and again in the fall if the season isn't full. Early in the quarter, an email will be sent to the [UT General Listhost](/listhosts) calling for proposals. This email will include the updated proposal form (which should also be available on our [resources page](/resources)), the deadline (typically Friday of 5th Week), [past proposals for reference](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1HuAAugsZYzhmiwkLl4oby_rL0uuALF2-?usp=sharing), and any other relevant information.

The first section of the proposal form is the UT Mainstage Proposal Notice. This should be completed and submitted to Committee *before* submitting the completed proposal. Please try to submit this section as soon as you can. This ensure that Committee is aware of who is likely to be proposing and can offer you guidance or assistance where needed. 

Proposers then meet with the UT Chair and their Proposal Liaison to discuss next steps. These include: meeting with TAPS Pro-Staff, finding the beginnings of a team, and completing the proposal form.

Once the completed proposal form, along with the script (or explanation of why the script is unavailable), has been submitted, proposers meet in small groups with members of Committee to answer questions and discuss the proposal. 

The Mainstage Proposal Meeting typically occurs 1 week after proposals are due. Proposers are given a few minutes to present their proposal, followed by a short Q&A. Any member of the UT community is welcome to come to hear the proposals and ask questions. After all of the proposals have been presented, Committee decides which proposals will be part of the upcoming season (for more details, see [the bylaws](/bylaws#V-B-4)). 

Committee reaches out to proposers immediately after the meeting to tell them whether their show has been passed. The full season is announced to the community later, after scheduling is confirmed with the space managers.


### Short Play Proposals

The Short Play proposal process is a simplified version of the mainstage process. It takes place twice per year, and often accepts submissions on a rolling basis. It is currently being re-worked, so a full explanation will be available once that process is completed.

For more information about the current process, refer to the the emails sent to the [UT General listhost](/about/listhosts) or [the bylaws](/bylaws#V-C-1).


### Dean's Men Proposals

The Dean's Men proposal process typically takes place in the Spring quarter of every year. The deadlines and details for this process are sent out via the [Dean's Men listhost](/about/listhosts)

For more information about the process, refer to [the bylaws](/bylaws#II-k-show-proposals).
