description: "Teams of writers, actors, directors and designers – led by four fearless curators – collaborate for a frenzied 24 hours to bring you an evening filled with brand-new plays centered around a top-secret theme the first weekend of every quarter. Never-before-seen and never-to-be-seen-again, this festival is not one to miss!<br>
Signups for all positions will be opening soon, and the 24-hour extravaganza kicks off the evening of Friday, September 30 in the FXK Theater. Or, come see the culmination of their work at 8pm on Saturday, October 1!
<br>See the performances from last quarter for a sneak preview at the antics to come, and follow the <a href='https://www.facebook.com/24hrtheater' target='_blank'>Facebook page</a> for the latest news."
