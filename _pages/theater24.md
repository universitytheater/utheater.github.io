Teams of writers, actors, directors, and designers – led by four fearless curators – collaborate for a frenzied 24 hours to bring you an evening filled with brand-new plays centered around a top-secret theme the first weekend of every quarter. Never-before-seen and never-to-be-seen-again, this festival is not one to miss!

The 24-hour extravaganza kicks off for participants on the evening of Friday, March 24 in the FXK Theater. Or, come see the culmination of their work at 8pm on Saturday, March 25! 

Feel free to [contact the Theater[24] curators](mailto:beth9@uchicago.edu,nmanley@uchicago.edu,amanduva@uchicago.edu,mayacdoyle@uchicago.edu) (Eli Gillespie, Natalie Manley, Antrita Manduva, Maya Doyle) with any questions!
