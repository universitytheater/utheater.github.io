Teams of writers, actors, directors, and designers – led by four fearless curators – collaborate for a frenzied 24 hours to bring you an evening filled with brand-new plays centered around a top-secret theme the first weekend of every quarter. Never-before-seen and never-to-be-seen-again, this festival is not one to miss!

The 24-hour extravaganza kicks off for participants on the evening of Friday, March 22, in the FXK Theater. Or, come see the culmination of their work at 8pm on Saturday, March 23. 

Feel free to [contact the Theater[24] curators](mailto:nmanley@uchicago.edu,bellegn@uchicago.edu,ccypher@uchicago.edu,emcurran@uchicago.edu) (Natalie Manley, Belle Nahoom, Camille Cypher, Emily Curran) with any questions!
