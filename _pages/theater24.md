Teams of writers, actors, directors, and designers – led by four fearless curators – collaborate for a frenzied 24 hours to bring you an evening filled with brand-new plays centered around a top-secret theme the first weekend of every quarter. Never-before-seen and never-to-be-seen-again, this festival is not one to miss!

The 24-hour extravaganza kicks off for participants on the evening of Friday of first week in the [FXK Theater](/locations/fxk). Or, come see the culmination of their work at 8pm on the following day (Saturday).

Feel free to [contact the Theater[24] curators](mailto:emcurran@uchicago.edu,rubioj@uchicago.edu,ozajac@uchicago.edu,cjpressey@uchicago.edu) (Emily Curran, Josiah Rubio, Oliver Zajac, and Clara Pressey) with any questions!
