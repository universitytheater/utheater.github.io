description: "<p>Teams of writers, actors, directors and designers – led by four fearless curators – collaborate for a frenzied 24 hours to bring you an evening filled with brand-new plays centered around a top-secret theme the first weekend of every quarter. Never-before-seen and never-to-be-seen-again, this festival is not one to miss!</p>
<p>Signups for all positions will be opening soon, and the 24-hour extravaganza kicks off the evening of Friday, September 30 in the FXK Theater. Or, come see the culmination of their work at 8pm on Saturday, October 1! See the performances from last quarter for a sneak preview at the antics to come, and follow the <a href='https://www.facebook.com/24hrtheater' target='_blank'>Facebook page</a> for the latest news.</p>"
