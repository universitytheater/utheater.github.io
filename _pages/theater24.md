Teams of writers, actors, directors, and designers – led by four fearless curators – collaborate for a frenzied 24 hours to bring you an evening filled with brand-new plays centered around a top-secret theme the first weekend of every quarter. Never-before-seen and never-to-be-seen-again, this festival is not one to miss!

The 24-hour extravaganza kicks off for participants on the evening of Friday of first week in the FXK Theater. Or, come see the culmination of their work at 8pm on the following day (Saturday).

Feel free to [contact the Theater[24] curators](mailto:ozajac@uchicago.edu,bellegn@uchicago.edu,rubioj@uchicago.edu,emcurran@uchicago.edu) (Belle Nahoom, Emily Curran, Josiah Rubio, Oliver Zajac) with any questions!
