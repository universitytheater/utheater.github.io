Teams of writers, actors, directors, and designers – led by four fearless curators – collaborate for a frenzied 24 hours to bring you an evening filled with brand-new plays centered around a top-secret theme the first weekend of every quarter. Never-before-seen and never-to-be-seen-again, this festival is not one to miss!

The 24-hour extravaganza kicks off for participants on the evening of Friday, January 6 in the FXK Theater. Or, come see the culmination of their work at 8pm on Saturday, January 7! 

Feel free to [contact the Theater[24] curators](mailto:beth9@uchicago.edu,nmanley@uchicago.edu,amanduva@uchicago.edu,mayacdoyle@uchicago.edu) (Eli Gillespie, Natalie Manley, Antrita Manduva, Maya Doyle) with any questions!
