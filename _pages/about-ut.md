### A Brief History

UT builds on a strong tradition of student-run theater at the University of Chicago that began in 1898. The administrative structure that currently governs UT was created in 1986, when various performing arts RSOs on campus combined under the University Theater header. Off-Off Campus, UT’s improvisational comedy troupe, was founded in 1986. The Dean’s Men, dedicated to performing Shakespeare plays during the theater seasons, was founded in 2006 and joined with University Theater in 2010.
