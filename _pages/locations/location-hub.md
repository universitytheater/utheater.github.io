While UT does not own or manage its own theaters, we regularly operate out of most of UChicago's major theaters. The majority of our shows take place in Logan Theater West, Logan Theater East, and the FXK Theater.

Information about physical (or otherwise location-based) accessibility can be found on the location pages linked below or by reaching out to [UT Committee](mailto:ut-committee@lists.uchicago.edu).
